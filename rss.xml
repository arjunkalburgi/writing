&lt;p&gt;After seeing a shift in the industry from Medium, it’s time I leave as well and host my blog on my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shouldn’t be too bad of a process, I just need to convert my Medium posts to markdown, set up a Gatsby blog, host on Github and do some styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convert to Markdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gautamdhameja.com/medium-to-markdown-converter/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I used medium-2-md to export and convert all my Medium posts to markdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;medium-2-md convertLocal medium-export/posts -df&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave me a large list of markdown files that looked like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2017-04-09_Security-Review--UX-of-Canadian-banking-applications-53aa77dd2cf4.md&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set Up Gatsby Blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby’s got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&quot;&gt;blog-starter&lt;/a&gt; repo, which was quick to clone and get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;/writing/static/4b88b012f4bf7635b0334df5de5a0280/b9e4f/initdeploy.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 59.152542372881356%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&amp;apos;data:image/png;base64,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&amp;apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;initdeploy&quot; title=&quot;initdeploy&quot; src=&quot;/writing/static/4b88b012f4bf7635b0334df5de5a0280/b9e4f/initdeploy.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/writing/static/4b88b012f4bf7635b0334df5de5a0280/cf440/initdeploy.png 148w,
/writing/static/4b88b012f4bf7635b0334df5de5a0280/d2d38/initdeploy.png 295w,
/writing/static/4b88b012f4bf7635b0334df5de5a0280/b9e4f/initdeploy.png 590w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then using some bash scripts to format my markdown posts to the file structure Gatsby expects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token for-or-select variable&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; *.md &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; -p &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;/blog/&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;/blog/&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;/index.md &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# make the new directory&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token for-or-select variable&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; *.md &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${d&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;*_}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# remove the date from the beginning of the directory name&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token for-or-select variable&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; *.md &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${d&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;-*.md}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# remove the &apos;.md&apos; from the end of the directory name&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token for-or-select variable&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${d&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;,,&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# lower case all characters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2017-04-09_Security-Review--UX-of-Canadian-banking-applications-53aa77dd2cf4.md&lt;/code&gt;, to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;security-review--ux-of-canadian-banking-applications&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps because now the url for my posts will look like: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/security-review--ux-of-canadian-banking-applications&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my blog is ready to go 😃. Thank you to my bff &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/afontaine_ca&quot;&gt;Andrew Fontaine&lt;/a&gt; for helping me out with this part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Host on Github Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Gatsby’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;gh-pages hosting tutorial&lt;/a&gt; I was able to get this done pretty easily. Just needed to make a repo in github, set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; in my local repo, follow the tutorial and then run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm run deploy&lt;/code&gt; . And I’m up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without CI, every time I push to Github I’ll need to run this command. This is okay for now but I’ll probably look to change this later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Styling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I could spend all day doing this, but for now I just want something quick. I’ll use a lot of the CSS I already have from my &lt;a href=&quot;www.arjunkalburgi.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. But for the blog posts, for now I’ll just copy what Varun’s got on &lt;a href=&quot;varun.ca/writing&quot;&gt;his site&lt;/a&gt;, it’s gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the simplicity of this task, it was actually quite time consuming to style the blog. Based on my commit history, it was the markdown posts that took forever to style. For some reason, Gatsby does not have this built into their default style for their starter package I used, making me wish I knew to use a theme’d starter from the beginning (there’s no way to change your theme afterwards.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty happy with the public facing results, but on the internal there’s a couple things I lose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is that I don’t have the nice editor Medium provides. I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://typora.io/&quot;&gt;Typora&lt;/a&gt; to fix this (using it right now). It lets me paste images into the markdown files and helps me out with presenting my images as well. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to use Modals in Ionic v4]]></title><description><![CDATA[After taking much too long to figure this out myself, I’m writing a blog post about it to help the next dev.

&lt;p&gt;After taking much too long to figure this out myself, I’m writing a blog post about it to help the next dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be easy, but the documentation for it is a little lacking. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/pull/17944#issuecomment-522067671&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; them to update it but just in case they don’t I’m writing this for your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally my issue was that the modal was activating too early, before the button-press to activate the modal. When I would navigate to the page that the modal should be accessed on, it would show the modal as a full page instead of the page I’ve navigated to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution will also help solve the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ERROR ERROR: &amp;quot;Uncaught (in promise): overlay does not exist&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; when trying to dismiss the modal. Another issue that I saw people having when trying to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creating a Modal Page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very basic, just run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ionic g page modal&lt;/code&gt; using Ionic CLI just like you would for any other new page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fixing the Routing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since modal pages aren’t part of your app navigation, you must remove the automatic entry for this page from your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app-routing-module.ts&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const routes: Routes = [
     { path: &amp;#39;&amp;#39;, redirectTo: &amp;#39;home&amp;#39;, pathMatch: &amp;#39;full&amp;#39; },  
     ...  
     {̵ ̵p̵a̵t̵h̵:̵ ̵&amp;#39;̵m̵o̵d̵a̵l̵&amp;#39;̵,̵ ̵  
       l̵o̵a̵d̵C̵h̵i̵l̵d̵r̵e̵n̵:̵ ̵&amp;#39;̵.̵/̵m̵o̵d̵a̵l̵/̵m̵o̵d̵a̵l̵.̵m̵o̵d̵u̵l̵e̵#̵M̵o̵d̵a̵l̵P̵a̵g̵e̵M̵o̵d̵u̵l̵e̵&amp;#39;̵ ̵}̵
];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fix the Modal’s Module&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is neccessary to solve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@NgModule({  
     declarations: \[ **ModalPage** \],  
     imports: \[ ... \],  
     entryComponents: \[ **ModalPage** \],  
     exports: \[ **ModalPage \]  
**})  
export class ModalPageModule {}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation does not show to include the page in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;entryComponents&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Declare the Modal for Use&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the modal’s module is ready, import it into the page you want to use it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@NgModule({  
     declarations: \[ HomePage, **ModalPage** \],  
     imports: \[ ... \],  
     entryComponents: \[ **ModalPage** \],})  
export class HomePageModule {}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation does not show either of these! This is a big part of how the issue happens. Including the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ModalPage&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/code&gt; is what creates the problem (and is what I thought to do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Create the Modal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is exactly how the documentation explains, I’m just including it here for completion’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { ModalController } from &amp;#39;@ionic/angular&amp;#39;;

export class **HomePage** {

  constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) { }

  async openModal() {  
    const loadAmount = await _this_.modalCtrl.create({  
      component: **ModalPage**  
    });  
    await loadAmount.present();  
  }

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dismiss the Modal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { ModalController } from &amp;#39;@ionic/angular&amp;#39;;

export class **ModalPage** {

  constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) { }

  async close() {  
    await _this_.modalCtrl.dismiss();  
  }

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like that, everything should be working perfectly. I was so relieved when I implemented these steps. Thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/706b6e4cb229&quot;&gt;Christian Francia&lt;/a&gt; for providing this solution in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/17939#issuecomment-479550015&quot;&gt;Github issue&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully this blog post will have a little better SEO and will be easier to find 😃&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learning About Time, After 3 Weeks Off]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve taken 3 weeks off before, I went to India for that long just 5 months ago — but the context around that trip and my most recent one…]]></description><link>https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/learning-about-time--after-3-weeks-off/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/learning-about-time--after-3-weeks-off/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 19:12:31 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken 3 weeks off before, I went to India for that long just 5 months ago — but the context around that trip and my most recent one were very different. Because now I have a job where I work until I burn out — I’m learning how to not do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent trip started in New York with a half-week with my cousins, where we walked all day and everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*o_GXcdRRPC2oFaRa&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then continued for a week with some more family, where we were such a big group we could only manage to visit one or two tourist attractions per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*s17pide54h3pTX80&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip continued further to LA, where even more family met up to take a week-long cruise down Mexico’s Pasific coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rJKeiFk6y25dKPhq&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because it was cheaper to fly out of LA a few days after the cruise docked, I stayed with my uncle in LA for 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So effectively I had a vacation (2 days in LA) for the vacation (cruise) for the vacation (touring NY). I was so fresh and high spirited upon coming back from this trip. I was excited about coming in to work this week, until I sat down to actually work…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groggy, lethargic, and unfocused. I spent the week diving into my backlog looking for work that I would be able to concentrate on and I’m actually still finding it so difficult to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m taking it easy, working myself back into my routine, because I’m learning that time is fickle, and things take time. 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I got an email expressing concern for finding a job, in my reply I explain what I call ‘&lt;strong&gt;The Infinite Job Search Game’.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I got an email expressing concern for finding a job. The sender is about to start a degree in Computer Science and was worried that Computer Engineering would have been the better choice for more job opportunities at the end of his degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After debunking the difference between the two disciplines, my advice to him was to play the &lt;em&gt;infinite job search game&lt;/em&gt;, the best way of finding a job. I first learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bFs6ZiynSU&amp;#x26;t=516s&quot;&gt;the infinite game from Simon Sinek&lt;/a&gt;, where he explains what the game is and how companies should play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for a job after my degree, I realized that networking and job search is also an infinite game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Infinite Job Search Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Get involved with something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Ask a question about it &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Find someone to answer it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Ask them the question via Twitter/Email/over coffee/etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Make them your mentor (ask them if they’ll meet with you and if you can approach them for future questions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Repeat&lt;br&gt;
6a. Contact the previous mentors every so often for coffee/questions/life updates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentorship is key to this game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings purpose to your networking, because it’s about finding and learning from mentors instead of simply trying to meet someone. The more you learn, the more questions you have, the more you try to meet people that can answer those questions and help you along your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I try to email/text/contact people from my (now long) list of mentors at least once a week - I’ll actively seek out questions to ask them. Thanks to context, having a conversation with someone can be better than Googling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies care about finding people that are good people, not really about smart people. They don’t care about degree’s or grades, they care about hiring someone that will learn and is fun to work with. Getting to know people will prove to them that you’re willing to learn and are enjoyable, if they’re good mentors they’ll help steer you to opportunities they think you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m really excited for the future Computer Science graduate that emailed me. I wonder how in 4 years his knowledge of The Infinite Job Search Game will boost his learnings and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*used5UdqOzSWNxql&quot; alt=&quot;Wish I knew the Infinite Job Search Game back in 2013&quot;&gt;
Wish I knew the Infinite Job Search Game back in 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A quick note on job postings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don’t look at job postings at all. They’re useless, and they’re slow. I’d rather them be thinking about me in their meetings while they’re creating the role itself (this has actually happened multiple times). That happens by getting to know them, and with referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to create a new app and I wanted to experiment with Flutter. My two concerns of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mx_tino/flutter-themes-9cebc0fecd1d&quot;&gt;themeing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-io/beautiful-animated-charts-for-flutter-164940780b8c&quot;&gt;charts&lt;/a&gt; were alieviated by two blog posts, but let’s try it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing Flutter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dreaded step is always installing an SDK just for experimenting… but here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install&quot;&gt;https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-Qz-Ht_Wt7XtfUiBO2tehg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to fix some installation issues which Flutter helped me out with. For a front-end developer, this was really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it also took forever, thanks to XCode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MuJ50QXKz3DI7FsuyFtWxQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After forever, we’re now ready to go! (I’m choosing to work in VS Code)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Andriod Emulator and iOS Simulator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could get to coding I had to set up the Android and iOS devices on my machine. Fortunately I had ones set up for previous projects, I just needed to launch them like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ flutter emulators&lt;br&gt;
$ flutter emulators —launch Pixel_2_XL_API_28&lt;br&gt;
$ flutter emulators —launch iOS Simulator&lt;br&gt;
$ flutter run -d all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This runs the starter app on both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NriZDJE1wntOJXn0xB8j-w.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starter App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to start messing around! I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; provided from the Flutter team as a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the tutorial, I created a list (useful) and started learning about Flutter’s state (not really though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/#0&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, which had me add interactive icons to list items to save them, navigate to a page to view saved list items, and begin theming the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Theming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theming is one of the big reasons I wanted to try Flutter and it’s got a theming framework I wanted to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SGb5vC4lmEvxolDwI2Lm5g.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*1IDC32PB1JC_3w4vOUC7lQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Times and Blue&quot;&gt;
Times and Blue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First try at theming was promising, even just with changing the font and the primary colour. I feel like it’s generally stuck to the typical Material Design layout with the AppBar shadow and the darker background colour. Fortunately, I was quickly able to fix those, but I’m not certain I can make Flutter bend to &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; my UI wishes, would need more exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*740y6H3WRm8JEZPbSM8tcQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally important as theming is the ability to have good graphs. For this I’m looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dev/packages/charts_flutter&quot;&gt;charts_flutter&lt;/a&gt; recommended by the quick tutorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-io/beautiful-animated-charts-for-flutter-164940780b8c&quot;&gt;blog post here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k3PI_0RZuvvD9CQRGYHfTQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial is to get a bar chart up but I need a line chart with specific properties, which proved to be much more difficult thanks to some of the code from the bar chart tutorial messing me up. I had to redo the bar chart demo a couple of times and add in &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/time_series_charts/simple&quot;&gt;this Line Chart demo&lt;/a&gt; carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EJS1ev59fgo2DpKWB6vnTg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t care for my chart being interactive, so I dropped that extra fluff from the tutorial. What I need is to make the graph moveable and zoomable along the yaxis, which I don’t think &lt;em&gt;flutter\&lt;/em&gt;charts_ will be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I tried anyway, starting with a bunch of different tutorials from &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/gallery.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I actually ran into a lot of errors while trying to set all these up and while some of them were clearly due to my unfamiliarity with Flutter, some of them were very: 🤨. That’s a drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up finding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/axes/numeric_initial_viewport&quot;&gt;Numeric Initial Viewport Axes Example&lt;/a&gt; which did the scrolling y-axis for me and just needed to combine it with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/behaviors/selection_callback_example.html&quot;&gt;Selection Callback Interactions Example&lt;/a&gt; (which features a TimeSeriesChart, which I need). This actually proved to be quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I wasn’t able to get it to work seemingly due to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/charts/issues/134&quot;&gt;bug that hasn’t been fixed&lt;/a&gt;. This is how it would’ve worked though, by setting up a viewport and allowing PanAndZoomBehavior.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;new charts.TimeSeriesChart(&lt;br&gt;
widget.seriesList,&lt;br&gt;
animate: widget.animate,&lt;br&gt;
domainAxis: new charts.DateTimeAxisSpec(&lt;br&gt;
viewport: new charts.DateTimeExtents(&lt;br&gt;
start: new DateTime(2017, 10, 3),&lt;br&gt;
end: new DateTime(2017, 10, 10))),&lt;br&gt;
behaviors: [new charts.PanAndZoomBehavior()],&lt;br&gt;
selectionModels: [new charts.SelectionModelConfig(&lt;br&gt;
type: charts.SelectionModelType.info,&lt;br&gt;
changedListener: _onSelectionChanged,&lt;br&gt;
)],&lt;br&gt;
)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out Flutter isn’t capable of the graphing I need :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Flutter seems like a pretty cool way to make apps but unfortunately it’s chart library isn’t functional and customizable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like I’m sticking to Ionic Angular with plot.ly :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been seeing a lot about CSS Grid on Twitter, decided to fix some smelly HTML/CSS on my portfolio using it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like I’ve settled into a learning process. As with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/viewing-vue-with-theradlist-8851502ab709&quot;&gt;learning Vue.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/arty-notes-sketch-noting-my-thoughts-e29f142a9eb4&quot;&gt;learning sketch-noting&lt;/a&gt;, I started with content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case it was this &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on CSS Tricks, it went over the basics of CSS Grid and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.container {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.item {  grid-column-start: &amp;lt;number&amp;gt;;  grid-column-end: &amp;lt;number&amp;gt;;  grid-row-start: &amp;lt;number&amp;gt;;  grid-row-end: &amp;lt;number&amp;gt;; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this much alone I was able to begin using the Grid for what I needed. I didn’t need to go over &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/code&gt;, grid gaps and item alignments. Although they would be really useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I needed this CodePen found in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began working in my own CodePen and didn’t define my grid properly so I went to an example to see how they had done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I figured it out I went on to finish recreating the layout. That became v1, which you can see here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic html and css&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I needed to animate the images like on my Portfolio. I copied over the Javascript and attached the necessary Javascript files (jQuery and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tgomilar.github.io/paroller.js/&quot;&gt;Paroller&lt;/a&gt;) to make the parallax effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This became v2 which is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I needed to make it responsive just like on my website. This is the real reason I wanted to update using CSS Grid. In the current version, I have additional HTML tags which I hide and show for mobile and desktop. I no longer wanted that extra HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began with removing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;display: grid&lt;/code&gt; from the container and then followed through adjusting all the other elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that. We have our completely old website with a brand new grid layout system. And by golly was that easy and pumpkin pie. The grid system is awesome for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/askalburgi.github.io/commit/00260e1192b41bc0e772f8c899e5ce8bae3d4ef2&quot;&gt;This is the commit&lt;/a&gt; where I make the move to the Grid System. In the HTML, I’m able to reduce 40 lines of code and in the CSS, I’m able to reduce ~11 lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*ErpqfbqYAI0nxy1UXajRcQ.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*tT72BY7voH4t1u4L1uOIww.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially in the HTML, I was able to reduce a lot. Honestly it speaks more to the terrible HTML I had before than to how great the Grid System is, but either way, I was able to fix the issue that I had!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this poem on the plane from Edmonton to Toronto in 2019. At the time I was upset about the concept of ‘Home’ and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3P3cs8-2V89x3DRn&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is Home?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home is where the heart is.&lt;br&gt;
Even if you’re homeless there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled being homeless&lt;br&gt;
But I had my friends to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on my way home now&lt;br&gt;
But I’d rather not go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because home is where the heart is,&lt;br&gt;
And my heart is back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🏠&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is becoming more and more professional, hopefully I can always post my more artsy expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated with sketch notes and bullet journalling. Recently I started trying my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with learning Vue, my process to start sketch noting was to learn via video first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with this YouTube playlist about sketch notes. They go over ideas of how you can create imagery for different phrases/concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I think there is probably better content out there to learn this, but Mike Rhode is the author of the Sketchnote Handbook so I watched his videos first. I started getting the concepts and applying them to my notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5eiLBfngln98WE4C&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*P45jNEcpZ88jT_6D&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are more art than others, while some have been more notes than art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to continue learning more note/art techniques to keep my sketch-noting going! If you have any resources or advice, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/askalburgi&quot;&gt;Tweet at me&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I sent a tweet to a stranger that I follow on Twitter asking for his help. The result? The coding culture on the Internet is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been really annoyed with the &lt;em&gt;leaves animation&lt;/em&gt; on my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though unnoticeable in use on my website, I hated how the leaves would bounce back and forth between two points but I didn’t really know how I could fix it (I’m new to animations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/1aeed18fd27d&quot;&gt;Varun Vachhar&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for some time and see his animation work all the time. Now that I moved my job search to Toronto, I decided to go out of my comfort zone and reach out to him about helping me on my animation. His response was more than I could’ve asked for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the Tweet to see the thread!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ended up making a CodePen that forked mine, showing me that GSAP can re-run the animation after completion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some tweaks to it and ended up with the following, which is now applied to my website! It’s a much more natural movement for the leaves! Thanks Varun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same thread, Varun also talked about using &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise&quot;&gt;p5 to animate noise&lt;/a&gt;, something I’ve never even heard of. I asked him to meet for coffee so I could learn more and he told me all kinds of background information about animation frameworks that I never knew! I think it’ll really help me learn animations moving forward because up till now it’s really been throwing darts in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess what I learned is that the process of randomly tweeting at people for code mentorship is pretty awesome! I’m definitely going to do it more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stylist Assistant, updating stylists to do more]]></title><description><![CDATA[My final year capstone project helps personal stylists recommend daily outfits for their clients and shows potential for market disruption…]]></description><link>https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/stylist-assistant--updating-stylists-to-do-more/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/stylist-assistant--updating-stylists-to-do-more/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 19:37:02 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final year capstone project helps personal stylists recommend daily outfits for their clients and shows potential for market disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stylist Assistant is a companion for stylists and their clients. In the industry today, personal stylists work with their clients closely, often on a daily basis, helping them achieve the client’s desired personal style goal. This makes being a personal stylist a full-time job, and hiring a personal stylist very expensive. Hence, very few people have a personal stylist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reducing the stylist’s time commitment we can reduce the time and cost barriers for clients, thus increasing the demand in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Collaborators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capstone projects at the University of Alberta’s Faculty of Engineering are usually in groups of 3–5. I worked on this project with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rui-wu-3812a2164/&quot;&gt;Rui Wu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/v%C3%ADtor-mendon%C3%A7a-221151b0/&quot;&gt;Vitor Mendonca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stylist Assistant seeks to help stylists with their clients daily style using image detection to recognize clothing items, data science to match outfits and a mobile app to interface between the two parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s potential to disrupt and grow the industry to a large degree makes it a potentially revolutionary technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Image Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;DeepFashion Dataset&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://liuziwei7.github.io/projects/DeepFashion.html&quot;&gt;DeepFashion Project&lt;/a&gt; in our research for existing solutions. It also studies the relationship between AI and fashion and so we used the project to help kickstart our solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepFashion was great for kickstarting us, but also for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html&quot;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; it provides. It had tagged data for all kinds of clothing features as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*DkyuFZrKj4CgmLzl.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the tags for texture, fabric, shape, part and style were completely inaccurate and we could not use them in our solution. We made do with just category and continued with the project as a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Neural Net&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built our own neural net for the image tagging. Using the TensorFlow library as a solution that worked and satisfied the course requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Neural Net was directly based off of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/&quot;&gt;Simonyan &amp;#x26; Zisserman’s entry to the ImageNet Competition 2014&lt;/a&gt; — also the basis for DeepFashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Alternatives Considered for Processing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to explore creating a custom classifier with the IBM Watson API, but decided this route would not satisfy the workload and learning requirements for the course. In our quick test, using DeepFashion and the custom classifier worked well as the Watson API is assisted by its existing knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/stylist-assistant/tree/master/Project%20Source/neural-network&quot;&gt;See the code for the Neural Net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the data science portion of the project is to combine outfits from the client’s wardrobe and to measure commonality between the stylist’s recommendation and the list of possible client’s outfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Using DeepFashion Categories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the list of all the possible clothing item categories in the DeepFashion dataset, we built 3 category trees in order to deduce similarity among items: Tops, Bottoms and Full-Body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xV3tu3251zPOZSr0_q0jzg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items in different trees have 0% similarity, items in different sections of the graph are 25% similar, items within the same section are 50% similar and items of the same category have 100% similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Similarity Matrix&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clothing piece similarity allowed us to then make outfit similarity measurements which could then be used to find the best matching outfit from the stylist’s recommended outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SISeI0rwJZYMaDVVocYF3g.png&quot; alt=&quot;The stylist’s recommended is on the right and the client’s wardrobe on the left.&quot;&gt;
The stylist’s recommended is on the right and the client’s wardrobe on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using outfit similarity we can retrieve the most similar outfit from the client’s wardrobe, resulting in an outfit (or outfits) for the client that satisfy the stylist’s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/stylist-assistant/tree/master/Project%20Source/recommender&quot;&gt;See the code for the Recommendation API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mobile App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stylist Assistant mobile app is used by both stylists and clients, meaning a user can be both a stylist and a client using the same app (provided they have different email addresses). This design decision was made to help keep the project’s scope relatively narrow. Companies like Uber originally kept both types of users, rider and driver, on the same app, but then grew into two apps as both sides of the service expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UX Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design patterns (visual layouts of the app views) were given less detailed thought, although some minor patterns which were more intuitive were implemented, such as tabs in the client side rather than a side menu. This follows the general design rule that discards the idea of keeping main features hidden in a side-menu navigation. The stylist side does feature a side-menu, but it is a much more acceptable design pattern for switching between clients. Similarly, the display of side-by-side cards was chosen over other list options for showing the wardrobe and recommended outfits of the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;UI Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note this project was done before taking the UI design course at RED Academy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visual aspects of the application, including the colours and fonts, were chosen to support emotional responses of reliability and elegance. The font, Eloquent Pro, and the colour black give an impression of sophistication. In colour theory, the use of navy is known to build feelings of trust and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These visual cues are present in the application in subtle ways, such as the tab-bar colour of the recommendations being navy to suggest that the recommendations are trustworthy. The rest of the application is a simple black and white to create a tone of elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Frontend&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose Ionic Framework for our app because it’s fast and reliable with simple UI tools that we could easily modify. After initializing views and navigation with default templating, everything was then redesigned to reflect our app mockups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked incrementally like this for the rest of the app as well, first adding functionality, then styling it and fixing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*LlK-kfS_7MU-mu_X&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*91yXBox7Oj-F21AI&quot;&gt;

Left to Right: Home screen, Client’s recommended outfits, Stylist’s client details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Backend&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Angular was being used in the frontend, we chose to use Firebase as our database in the backend. Firebase has a number of useful features and works great with Angular as both are Google-backed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used Firebase login to handle accounts and sign-in and to quickly show data within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firebase was great but there was a lot of compatibility issues because somehow we ended up with Angular v1 in our Ionic app working with a much higher version of Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/stylist-assistant/tree/master/Project%20Source&quot;&gt;See the code for the mobile app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient accuracy in our classification. I think if the DeepFashion dataset was what it promised to be, we would have had something really valuable on our hands. Neural nets really need consistent data to yield good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project as it stands relies on stylists to help the app build fashionable outfits tailored to the client’s fashion goals. We believe that it would be possible for our system to work without the stylist’s input if there was a sufficiently large and accurate database. DeepFashion was just not that database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key Learning Lesson&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is a great tool that can be leveraged to do great things, but clean and accurate data is really hard to come by and without it those great things aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Vue.js by updating one of my more simpler projects, TheRadList, the Edmonton restaurant webapp that restores the excitement of finding a place to grub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Whk_KRBeoqPW-cYg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TheRadList is a project I started in January of 2018. Every once in a while I’ll bring it back to update it or use it to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the total history of TheRadList updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/im-more-lazy-than-you-backends-with-google-spreadsheets-3eeac8d135c1&quot;&gt;Update so that my friends can easily modify content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/theradlist/angular-radlist&quot;&gt;Update to learn Angular 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/theradlist-a-new-side-product-e07bf0d3fdd8&quot;&gt;Initial launch of the project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m using it to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org&quot;&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt;, one of today’s most popular web frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning Vue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning a new framework isn’t too difficult, since a lot of them take concepts from each other and most have great learning tools online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/&quot;&gt;Vue.js docs&lt;/a&gt; to see what I could learn. There I found a video series from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js&quot;&gt;Vue Mastery called “Intro to Vue.js”&lt;/a&gt; which covers all the core principles of Vue.js and also builds a sample app along with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t bother with the sample app, because TheRadList is my sample app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Planning my Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After picking up all the core concepts and functionality of Vue.js, I looked at TheRadList’s HTML to see how I could refactor and update it with Vue.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SVkBXGeYCdj6H6fw&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the App Component needs to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Emitting-a-Value-With-an-Event&quot;&gt;emitted messages&lt;/a&gt; from the Filter Component, which will then update the List Component via &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#One-Way-Data-Flow&quot;&gt;props&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, I also want to make my filter functions capable of filtering through multiple properties. But that’s more of a stretch goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building out my App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refactoring should always be done incrementally and that’s essentially what this process is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began with creating components and slowly turning them into what I needed, using the documentation and the videos from the core principles course as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*h0h--08SQGxQUkJGg2uzXQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Git commits tracking my incremental progress&quot;&gt;
Git commits tracking my incremental progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely I replaced all the functionality of the previous website. Starting with the component for the top hero section, then the component for the filter section and finally the rad list itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comments and Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always great to document the things you learned and the things you can do better. Something that can nearly always be improved in the components and how they work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More Components&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible more components might be helpful, especially the for UI. For example each filter in the Filter Component can be its own component, this would mean more component-oriented CSS, helpful for designers and developers both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Component Efficiency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner-component structure is another way to improve your app. I updated how the filter-props (props that control the list filters) were passed into the List Component, yielding a much more readable approach that’s also good for performance. (the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt; function is slow)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j5_TYqnW1RSfIW9R_7WiWw.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*WDLgd9EwIyG0jQELpGQV5Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;Updating List Component to take in 1 prop for all the filters&quot;&gt;
Updating List Component to take in 1 prop for all the filters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Arrow Function Quirkiness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took me quite a while to figure out why my watch function wasn’t working when trying to watch for when the user toggles the “Deep Dive” view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watch: {&lt;br&gt;
expand: (newVal, oldVal)=&gt;{ this.expanded = (newVal==“large”) }&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/40557674&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, it’s simply because arrow functions (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;()=&amp;gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;) don’t take in bindings for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t work inside them! Just reverting back to regular function syntax fixed the problem. A good lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watch: {&lt;br&gt;
expand(newVal, oldVal) { this.expanded = (newVal==“large”) }&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Single File Components&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I’d love to get to are &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html&quot;&gt;Vue’s Single File Components&lt;/a&gt;, making Vue projects further like Angular and React with separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a simple app like TheRadList, I didn’t see a point in adding this functionality, so instead I separated out my components into files. It helps with readability abstraction but isn’t nearly as beneficial as Single File Components themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*9mbSlucUkIF34qBA&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visit TheRadList at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theradlist.com&quot;&gt;www.theradlist.com&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t see any difference (other than a few style bug fixes I found). But now you’ll know that the site uses Vue.js!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need a professional response for questions regarding my trip. This is me trying to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid my parents didn’t buy me video games, instead we travelled around the world. I caught the travel bug early and have it often. I can never miss the opportunity to experience something different, and India definitely was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HVRT8SRb-B823eRT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to India before, but this was the first time as an adult and it made a big difference. Even when sitting at home, I never missed an opportunity to listen, watch and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gravitated to situations regarding people, how they think and relate to one another. India is a place with a lot of social tension caused from so many factors: the caste system, economic status, opposing religions and more. In the West we talk about diversity, but in India it’s another beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EZV-ObexF-swYxeW&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be immature and ignorant of me to say anything definitive about what I learned of India’s tumultuous social landscape, it was only 3 weeks, but I had a great experience trying to learn about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I hope to do this more often and take it a step further by building small solutions around some of the things I learn.&lt;/p&gt;

(in India no less ➡ &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/what-i-did-in-india-for-3-weeks-in-2019-f0aa9671c021&quot;&gt;about my trip&lt;/a&gt;). It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*uvXFHkNWEbWeJ5Mp&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the 8am beginners class and made my way to the beach. What followed was a phenomenal practice in Growth Mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 2 other girls that took the beginner class with me. They were able to to stand on the board after a couple of tries (we were each paired with an instructor that would help push the board and all we were practicing was being able to stand up and get balanced).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t stand on the board until 10 minutes left in the 2 hour class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell so many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After every fall I’d ask my instructor what did I do wrong? He would tell me, and I would try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point he’s said “bro one more and we’ll take a break”, to which I said “fuck breaks! I’m getting this shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2 hours, the other two girls were able to stand like 70 times. I was only able to stand 4 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it ended in the best way, my instructor looks at his watch and told me it’s going to be the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I rode the wave all the way to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I kept failing, it wasn’t frustrating at all. I kept thinking about Mindset and what it means to fail. I put so much effort into concentrating and observing what I was doing so when my instructor told me what I was doing wrong I knew exactly what he was talking about. It was so awesome to force myself to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, I had so much fun. 100% would do it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve experimented with WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://html5up.net&quot;&gt;HTML5UP&lt;/a&gt;, Github Pages, and now I’ve got a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say hello to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sheety.co/&quot;&gt;Sheety&lt;/a&gt;, the shitty database API (as far as databases go) that’s also the best at being fast and easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ppV1HxVjysDSUgBcaL3HbQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheety was made by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/@phillipcaudell&quot;&gt;Phillip Caudell&lt;/a&gt; “because he hates making backends” and honestly it’s the greatest thing ever for front end developers like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at an example. I’ve rebuilt my old project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/theradlist-a-new-side-product-e07bf0d3fdd8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TheRadList&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to use Sheety so that my friends can easily edit the restaurant content on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A8M_qmhSM5Lf3TZTr4LZjA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;TheRadList with data from Sheety&quot;&gt;
TheRadList with data from Sheety&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spreadsheet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve moved all the data from a JSON var in the JS of TheRadList (yes, that’s how far I went to avoid using a backend) to this Google Spreadsheet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VkNJX7cwCfKx3h7QCqwwGQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends have edit access to this spreadsheet and I made them a custom link to make it easier to find: &lt;a href=&quot;https://theradlist.com/data&quot;&gt;https://theradlist.com/data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the Google Docs Publish Link into Sheety’s API tool results in the following API link for me to use!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://api.sheety.co/c1471c68-f293-46d9-ab4c-ca5e24e6e24e&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://api.sheety.co/c1471c68-f293-46d9-ab4c-ca5e24e6e24e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the data as objects in a list, it’s easy for me to read via JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Javascript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied the example on the Sheety website to load the data from the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;var template;&lt;br&gt;
$(document).ready(function () {&lt;br&gt;
$.getJSON(&lt;br&gt;
’&lt;a href=&quot;https://api.sheety.co/c1471c68-f293-46d9-ab4c-ca5e24e6e24e&amp;#x27;&quot;&gt;https://api.sheety.co/c1471c68-f293-46d9-ab4c-ca5e24e6e24e’&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
function (data) {&lt;br&gt;
template = Handlebars.compile($(‘#item-template’).html())&lt;br&gt;
$(‘#list-places’).html(template(data))&lt;br&gt;
})&lt;br&gt;
})&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses Handlebars to load the data into the specific &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#item-template&lt;/code&gt; I made and then into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Filters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Sheety doesn’t have any endpoint logic, so I can’t retrieve specific objects or filter using the API. So instead I save the data into a variable and do simple list filter operations. Unfortunately none of the filter data is present at the moment so they all return an empty list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nested Objects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did another project with Sheety where I needed to my data to have some nested objects and/or lists within the object. Sheety’s CSV style is obviously not suited for this. My solution was to create more Google Spreadsheets for the inner-data and use a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;primary_id&lt;/code&gt; to link all the data together. Then combine objects in JS &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;onLoad&lt;/code&gt;. Who ever thought Database class would come in handy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Updating Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Spreadsheet is updated, Google/Sheety take some time for the changes to be reflected. Sometimes it’s instant but sometimes it takes a couple minutes. I don’t recommend using it for chat apps 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/theradlist-a-new-side-product-e07bf0d3fdd8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TheRadList&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today to see Sheety in action! Well it’s not that exciting, you won’t even see it, but it’s lazy and that’s what counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vEvTmyn1_kOqvS7y&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team chose to personalize the content imagery that viewers can see across CBC’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*955m2ZY2NLo1di7W&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created user’s personas using the articles they read previously to determine their interests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6x929TDzB58FoyegYZAucQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And created metadata for the CBC content using Google’s NLP API to find topics from the content’s description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Hq1EeGwy1U8H3sm45IHElA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To decide what to show the viewer, we match the two sets of keywords together and use it for our image lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6sHiE4cDtbYQhVfvbOsJFQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus, we have two different UI’s for the different users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jsEg1rsb6MxWoWLO-nYHEA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developing Engaging Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on the front end (and a little bit of design) for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hackathon Starter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a github repository called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter&quot;&gt;Hackathon Starter&lt;/a&gt; that we used to quick start the application. It’s just a simple boilerplate Node.js app designed to be as versatile as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleaned out most of the app and built my own view using &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5up.net&quot;&gt;HTML5UP&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://html5up.net/forty&quot;&gt;Forty&lt;/a&gt; template that would become the view of our app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implementing the API&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;axios&lt;/code&gt; to call the API my group-mates prepared for the front-end and created a new router for the application to take in a userId from the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inputting the userId from the URL just made sense for this project since CBC Radio Canada doesn’t actually have accounts, so user data is actually stored through browser cache. Using a router was better than creating a “log in” page since the real CBC Radio Canada wouldn’t have a log in anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fixing the Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML5UP’s Forty is a great template, but it didn’t follow Radio Canada’s mandatory accessibility guidelines. I put a bit of my CSS and design skills to work fixing these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I fixed the text size, good accessibility should have text size above 12px.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I fixed the colour contrast of the white text on the image content tiles by changing the colours to values that have acceptable contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made sure that text was not &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;uppercase&lt;/code&gt; . Uppercase text is harder to read and screen readers will read this text as shouting. A poor experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly I added an animation to only show descriptions on hover, this was so that you could better see the images in the background. Accessibility guidelines state that all hidden text should still be readable by screen readers, so I found a way to create the animation without using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;display: none&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CBCRCHackathon2018/engaging-imagery-website&quot;&gt;View all code on Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we did what we wanted, creating an entirely new experience for Radio Canada viewers with personalized content. We’re really proud of our work, this was a great project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently re-read all the Harry Potter books and when I read that quote in the midst of following Harry’s difficult journey, it really spoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought, how would you avoid this? How are you supposed to remember what it is to be young as you age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m young now, I don’t want to forget what I’m like when I’m old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept thinking about this into January, and when the new 10 years challenge took Instagram by storm it became even more important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*U9vtIaWqtGWZIp36&quot; alt=&quot;Photos of me in 2008 and 2009&quot;&gt;
Photos of me in 2008 and 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be lying if I told you I remembered any of these moments, much less how I thought or how I behaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly photos aren’t enough to satisfy that main question. But videos could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to start vlogging again, just for myself. And not necessarily about something interesting, I just want to tell my future self about my current self and how life is going. How I feel and how I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe if interesting things are happening in my life I’ll edit it together and post it. But right now it’s more important to just film. I don’t want to forget me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m finding myself say “I can just make that myself” more and more often when I’m taking inspiration and hacking websites together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animations kept me away for some time because I always felt they were more complicated than I wanted to deal with. But recently that’s changing, mostly because I don’t want to deal with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8fs1I6BtirDdLZiwoza_xw.png&quot; alt=&quot;An excerpt from a 63 page JS file, size 12 font&quot;&gt;
An excerpt from a 63 page JS file, size 12 font&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites I’m finding have a lot of JavaScript, too much for my low patience to go through. So, I’ve been making the animations on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with some falling leaves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning that super simple TweenMax tweens and a lot of playing around. Slowly I started understanding how the tween settings worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next came when I was working on my newest project, my Online Library. I wanted to copy the side menu slide-out I found online. Instead of dealing with that site’s minified and messy JS, just making my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this great gallery animation from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andrgavr.com/en/&quot;&gt;www.andrgavr.com&lt;/a&gt; and after trying to hack it together with the menu slide out animation, my head went “I can just make that”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one still needs some fine tuning, but I’m loving my newfound animation confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I’m going to try recreating this gif in After Effects and using Lottie to get it into my Online Library project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OXD9RfgmQzgVODT3_xj08A.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post to come about my Online Library soon, just got to get these animations done :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently at Krugo, I was implementing a custom loading animation. I don’t usually write about work things, but this one was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First, the Setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I implemented this BehaviorSubject in my Dependency Injection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;var progressBar&lt;/strong&gt;: BehaviorSubject&lt;Boolean&gt; = BehaviorSubject.createDefault(&lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt; setProgressBar(value: Boolean) {&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;progressBar&lt;/strong&gt;.onNext(value)&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And subscribed to it from the MainActivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injector.&lt;strong&gt;progressBar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;em&gt;subscribeBy&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br&gt;
onNext = &lt;strong&gt;{&lt;br&gt;
if&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt;) {&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;.mainProgress.&lt;em&gt;visibility&lt;/em&gt; = View.&lt;em&gt;VISIBLE&lt;/em&gt; } &lt;strong&gt;else&lt;/strong&gt; {&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;.mainProgress.&lt;em&gt;visibility&lt;/em&gt; = View.&lt;em&gt;GONE&lt;/em&gt; }&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;}&lt;/strong&gt;,onError = &lt;strong&gt;{}&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;em&gt;addTo&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;compositeDisposable&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These together allow me to toggle the ProgressBar view (that was set up in activity_main) simply by calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Injector.setProgressBar(**true**)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Injector.setProgressBar(**false**)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Second, the Animation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the fun part. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://shapeshifter.design/&quot;&gt;Shape Shifter&lt;/a&gt; to make the animation, this is what I made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TOT7NQcg-4VcfbAynbk7vA.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shape Shifter allows you to export the animation as an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;animated-vector&lt;/code&gt; , made just for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that breaking that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;animated-vector&lt;/code&gt; into four separate files worked best. The first is the main file, make sure your ProgressBar uses this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;animated-vector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
android:drawable=”&lt;strong&gt;@drawable/your_vector_file&lt;/strong&gt;“&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;**target**  
    android:name=&amp;quot;group1&amp;quot;  
    android:animation=&amp;quot;**@anim/your\_first\_animation\_file**&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  

&amp;lt;**target**  
    android:name=&amp;quot;group2&amp;quot;  
    android:animation=&amp;quot;**@anim/your\_second\_animation\_file**&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x3C;/&lt;strong&gt;animated-vector&lt;/strong&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vector file, taken from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vector&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;animated-vector&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;vector&lt;/strong&gt; android:name=“vector”&lt;br&gt;
android:viewportWidth=“1024”&lt;br&gt;
android:viewportHeight=“1024”&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;group&lt;/strong&gt; … /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;group&lt;/strong&gt; … /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;/&lt;strong&gt;vector&lt;/strong&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the two animation files taken from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;target&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; sections and placed under &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;res/anim/&lt;/code&gt; . They’ll look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;set&lt;/strong&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;objectAnimator&lt;/strong&gt; … /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;objectAnimator&lt;/strong&gt; … /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;objectAnimator&lt;/strong&gt; … /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;objectAnimator&lt;/strong&gt; … /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x3C;/&lt;strong&gt;set&lt;/strong&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Third, Making it Work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all great, but it didn’t exactly work. The animation wouldn’t repeat itself after it completed. Took a while but finally got it working by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ProgressBar&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ImageView&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x3C;&lt;strong&gt;ImageView&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
android:contentDescription=“@string/loading”&lt;br&gt;
android:id=”@+id/progress_bar”&lt;br&gt;
android:layout_width=“200dp”&lt;br&gt;
android:layout_height=“200dp”&lt;br&gt;
android:layout_gravity=“center” /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialize the animation including &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;registerAnimationCallback&lt;/code&gt; to force the looping of the animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;val&lt;/strong&gt; avd = AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat.create(&lt;em&gt;applicationContext&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
R.drawable.&lt;em&gt;your\&lt;/em&gt;vector_file&lt;em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
findViewById&lt;ImageView&gt;(R.id.&lt;/em&gt;progress_bar&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;apply_ &lt;strong&gt;{&lt;/strong&gt; setImageDrawable(avd)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;}&lt;br&gt;
**avd?.registerAnimationCallback(&lt;/strong&gt;obj&lt;strong&gt;:Animatable2Compat.AnimationCallback() {&lt;br&gt;
**override fun&lt;/strong&gt; onAnimationEnd(drawable: Drawable?) {&lt;br&gt;
avd.start()&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;
})&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it off, I added &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;start()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stop()&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_subscribeBy_&lt;/code&gt; method just to be nice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injector.&lt;strong&gt;progressBar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;em&gt;subscribeBy&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br&gt;
onNext = &lt;strong&gt;{&lt;br&gt;
if&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt;) {&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;.mainProgress.&lt;em&gt;visibility&lt;/em&gt; = View.&lt;em&gt;VISIBLE&lt;/em&gt; avd?&lt;em&gt;.start()&lt;/em&gt; } &lt;strong&gt;else&lt;/strong&gt; {&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;.mainProgress.&lt;em&gt;visibility&lt;/em&gt; = View.&lt;em&gt;GONE&lt;/em&gt; avd?&lt;em&gt;.stop()&lt;/em&gt; }&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;}&lt;/strong&gt;,onError = &lt;strong&gt;{}&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;em&gt;addTo&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;compositeDisposable&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last step took me a while to figure out but I finally got it thanks to this article from the Android Developers blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/re-animation-7869722af206&quot; title=&quot;https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/re-animation-7869722af206&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-animation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If you were holding off adding awesome animation to your application because of lack of API support, then hold-off-no-more&lt;/em&gt;medium.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/re-animation-7869722af206&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I loved the chance to work on some animation, I think it’s just going to become a bigger thing in 2019 and more of a priority for me to learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress overwhelms people, but why? Prioritizing tasks and activities requires one simple trick, understanding that you can only give 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While taking a UI Design course at RED Academy in Toronto, I stayed with my grandma for 4 months. She was pretty busy over that time with an assortment of events and activities that required planning and prep work, all of which stressed her out beyond belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that I took my own stress management skills, built up over 5 years of my engineering degree, for granted. Some people just can’t help getting stressed under the pressure of a todo list, my grandma was proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TR8YgL7Xt5zFyM034CKZzg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reasoned that part of her stress came from not keeping a proper physical list, but also from being unable to recognize what tasks required more time and energy relative to others. This would lead her to become overwhelmed by the workload she had in front of her. If she could understand that she is only capable of 100%, whether that be 100% of the time in a day or 100% of her energy, she would have a much better time focusing on what matters as opposed to stressing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*g-6EkJmhC-H2WJVeC9OrUg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The objective of “Stressful Tasks”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stressful tasks” is a simple tool where users can list and rate their tasks when they feel overwhelmed. The tool helps them understand what to prioritize and calm them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Designing Stressful Tasks:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design Inception&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve the calming effect of the app, I wanted to go with a calming design language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ewdZXWq7tHNQynz-hulCew.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Style Guide:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design language uses pastel colours and features white space, both help to bring a tranquil experience. The doughnut chart is the center of the app’s design language, a unique visual that easily communicates task priorities to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HLPtwpGkTAvblxrnTKSqSg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Interface:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the strong pull of the doughnut chart, the design of the app can be very simple and stripped down. In only one screen, I feature the list of tasks and the doughnut chart. This should be sufficient to achieve the desired objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*W9_dwvpHAeVHacgohhUOvQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coding the Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ionic Framework&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my previous React Native project and being restricted stylistically by React Native’s StyleSheet, I wanted to use Ionic Framework. I typically use Ionic for smaller scale apps because of how fast it is to develop them. I love Ionic Framework as a good way to quickly do your side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another positive of Ionic Framework is that it uses basic HTML and CSS, allowing me to try BEM, the CSS classification methodology. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/using-the-bem-methodology-for-my-css-classifications-a35172f90a04&quot;&gt;I write about BEM and my experience with it here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;chart.js&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specifically wanted the doughnut chart to be animated. I want to start animating more of my apps because I realize how powerful animations can be. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chartjs.org/&quot;&gt;chart.js&lt;/a&gt; because it comes pre-built with animations. The updated function is as follows: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.doughnutChart.update();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/Stressful-Tasks&quot;&gt;View all the code on Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I finished the app I immediately began showing it to friends and using it myself. The little experiment sparked much discussion, both on its visual and behavioural design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*82moRFoyndgveERyMS_9Dg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Visual Representation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion around how Stressful Tasks visualizes priority of the tasks garnered the most attention. This is because most apps do not have a visualization component, thus Stressful Tasks got a lot of praise for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was however a lot of feedback and confusion of what the doughnut chart was supposed to represent. In the design phase, I intentionally left it up to the user to designate value to the tasks. Unfortunately this didn’t fly for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential solutions discussed would all end up making the app more complicated. One solution was to change the chart to be a 2-axis, priority vs. difficulty plot, where users can plot their tasks by rating them and so can easily see where their stress is most required. This would be an interesting and extremely useful method, but there is no way someone would use such a complicated app when they feel so overwhelmed and stressed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Behavioural Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the app was pretty difficult to use as is. Both the UI and UX design choices made the app brutal to use. In an overwhelmed and stressed out state, the app is just too slow to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one big oversight of my design was not properly prioritizing the behavioural design of the app. When you feel overwhelmed the most important thing to do is to dump out your tasks and visualize them, but this behaviour is not supported thanks to the small button sizes and the slow input for adding new tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best improvement would be to introduce a bottom fixed chat style text input for adding tasks (like many messaging apps) and integrate the functionality for modifying task priorities with the doughnut chart in an interactive way. These two things would essentially eliminate the buttons of the app in an attempt to “get out of the way” of the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app has a lot more visual design issues than mentioned here, I encourage you to try it out on both mobile and desktop and try to discover them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No one taught me about DNS or Domain Registrars, I needed a domain so I got one. For 4 years &lt;em&gt;arjunkalburgi.com&lt;/em&gt; was my online home, and it worked great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I decided to let my domain expire and pick it back up with another service. Over the four years I learned that GoDaddy wasn’t the best service and what’s the harm in switching?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the lesson:&lt;/strong&gt; DNS Registrars have a shady business model (and online, GoDaddy is especially doubted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that domains don’t just “expire”. If you miss your opportunity to renew (before your domain expires) the domain goes into a parked state but you can pay a hefty fee to get it back. If you cancel your domain, the registrar will “process” it for up to two months before letting it go back on the market. If you choose not to pay the fee, you’ll either have to switch domains or wait domainless for the processing to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To switch services, the proper thing to do is to pay the transfer free to transfer your domain to another registrar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, you can find my website at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://askalburgi.github.io/&quot;&gt;https://askalburgi.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and yes, a lot of my apps and services are currently down until I fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Edit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 18 11AM MDT, I was able to purchase my domain from NameCheap. For just over 2.5 months I didn’t have a domain, but by moving to NameCheap I’m saving $15 CAD per year for the rest of my life. For the stress and the lesson, that money is totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

With the express purpose of being able to easily Copy+Paste assets when I need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website features the colours, logos, iconography and imagery that can be found on my main &lt;a href=&quot;https://askalburgi.github.io&quot;&gt;portfolio site&lt;/a&gt;, all in big clickable buttons to easily Copy+Paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last month, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at just how awesome this has been working out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just used my style guide to quickly give a theme to my CodePen profile after finding out that one can do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pRv5-0gsHVyFSK7unTIe6Q.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did it quite hastily, but I’m impressed with myself how painless and quick it was to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m definitely going to be adding more and more to my Style Guide website, and be making more of these for other websites and styles I work on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next chapter in my quest to learn more about animating SVG on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I used SVG’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/code&gt; tag to animate a new Slackify logo I was working on. Here I did the same thing but with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://greensock.com/&quot;&gt;GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP, GreenSock)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I could have done the animation entirely in CSS, the purpose of this experiment was to see how I could animate using the multiple SVG’s I had created previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AtJwk7_cpzGFJI6nZkMsjg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same screenshot of my Figma design asset from before. There are 4 paths here that I want to animate to each other with an easing between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With SVG’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/code&gt; the preferred effect was not achieved, though mostly the basic motion was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I had a lot of trouble trying to adapt my SVG’s because GSAP isn’t perfectly meant to be used to manipulate the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; path of SVG elements. However, I eventually figured out how to do it after a bunch of Google searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl.to(dotA,&lt;br&gt;
0.8, {&lt;br&gt;
attr: {&lt;br&gt;
d: “M59.0596 … 959Z”&lt;br&gt;
},&lt;br&gt;
ease: Power1.easeInOut,&lt;br&gt;
})&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick just happened to be to wrap the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; modification in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;attr&lt;/code&gt; block. This successfully applied the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dotA&lt;/code&gt; path element in the SVG with the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on to apply this same animation to the other 4 path elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GOG3jx9dVNpwbrq4TjvZAA.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a theory as to why there is that strange sharpness of the dots during the animation, but that’s for another blog!&lt;/p&gt;

I found that SVG offers a great &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[animate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate&quot;&gt;property&lt;/a&gt; and so I decided I’d animate a brand new logo for Slackify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AtJwk7_cpzGFJI6nZkMsjg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I planned out my animation and in Figma I created several SVG’s. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/code&gt; only works if all the paths in your SVG have the same number of points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up creating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MvBfM58ir8Y4S17gJyBzzw.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not special but fun to try out. I also made this &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/askalburgi/pen/vQOJLE&quot;&gt;codepen of the svg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t click it, it doesn’t work. Turns out &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/code&gt;’s browser support isn’t that great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to try it in the React-Native Slackify app anyway. I found a nice little package to embed my SVG as an Image in the app, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[react-native-remote-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-remote-svg)&lt;/code&gt;, after trying a lot of other options that didn’t work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately the animated SVG did not load in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried to load the SVG in a React-Native &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;, thinking maybe the WebView’s browser support would be different, but unfortunately that didn’t work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ve got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bfzlPng2aLxqJDms2hS8zQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤷🏾‍ Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know how I could have done this &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt; in React-Native, &lt;strong&gt;please let me know!&lt;/strong&gt; I really want to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

Using them is the same idea of using proper naming conventions for your property names, file names, and variable names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbem.com&quot;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for Block Element Modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first time I used it, I got it all wrong and I wanted to write about my lesson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assumed that BEM was hierarchical, just like how we usually name variables and properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to produce HTML like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X7MIYOSLNPx05ZZ04UxDUA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&lt;/code&gt; is my Block, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-tasks__(something)&lt;/code&gt; are the Elements and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--stress&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--fine&lt;/code&gt; the Modifiers of certain elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This improper use led to the problem highlighted in blue in the above picture. I’ve got three buttons and they have wildly different class names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They should be something like: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st-buttonsomething--stress&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st-buttonsomething--fine&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st-buttonsomething--add&lt;/code&gt;. This way I can have a single button style with slight differences in the modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson I learned is that Element names don’t come from their position in the HTML but rather their style as a design asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BqMc2OG08PhJ68VEnYWxJw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where elements don’t depend on their position but rather their function and design/look/style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed the HTML of my buttons, but you can still see that I now have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st-buttonBg&lt;/code&gt; as the Element class and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st-buttonBg--fine&lt;/code&gt; as the Modifier class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a quick lesson I learned when using BEM. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/cssinate&quot;&gt;Paul Grant&lt;/a&gt; for helping me learn the lesson and encouraging me to write about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see something fantastic in the real world, maybe you can make it better? Sometimes a small tool can make a big impact and tell a great story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two summers I worked at a company who had a Slack group culture I’d never seen before. Their lead designer would hack together pictures and gifs of other employees and turn them into Slack emojis for the company to use. They were so much fun to use and getting your own emoji felt like being further accepted into the culture of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing what an amazing effect custom Slack emojis could have, I decided to try it out in my own Slack group for the University of Alberta Computer Engineering Club (CompE Club). The new club president had a mandate to make the club more fun and friendly so this was a great opportunity to test the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting my picture taken and posted in the Slack group when I fell asleep in the clubroom, I decided to take that picture and make it a meme to turn into Slack emojis. CompeCheeks and CompeForehead were born:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OBm4tAGYdUiVVRzfYdsW5g.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emojis were huge hits, bringing a new dynamic of fun and joking around to our Slack group. They worked so well that the next year, friends who had graduated messaged me expressing how much they they missed the CompE emoji reactions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The objective of this project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is to design and develop a clean and simple mobile app that makes uploading custom Slack emojis easy and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QYxBOJ9L7WkLSDgvlYA_QW-j0uUHDGDZWHk3M0YrZBs/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;View presentation slides for this project here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QnJhLtTd_b5B80E2gaZdSg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slackify:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slackify is a React Native Expo app that allows users to choose photos from their Camera roll for them to upload to Slack. With this app, a team can quickly grow their custom emoji index with all manner of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Designing Slackify:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design Inception&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, I thought about the types of feelings that Slackify users would have as they downloaded and used the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LUlC8xj3VzAlNA5F7CdQrw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took inspiration from Slack’s hashtag logo with a beautiful tartan pattern I found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Style Guide:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design language I chose for Slackify was to be very clean and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qwYe-c1TdkRH3ncYbubhBA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Black and Yellow design is very bright and bold thanks to the high contrast and the powerfulness of the Yellow. The use of PTSans-Caption, with its unique serifs, helps the Black text keep up with how punchy and vibrant the Yellow is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Screens:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the stripped down and simple design I only thought about the functionality that the user needed. The user would need to log into their Slack team, so I created a simple sign in screen, and then be able to upload emojis from their photo album. Users would need to see what Slack team they are uploading to and change that team if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*_euqi2hQAn4DHTpvlUlCnQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*Ko0FjWKYEEqEqVYZjTej_g.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*wVqy0a6U6WG10G6HCbM84w.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is kept minimalist as the functionality is also quite minimal, this makes the app very approachable and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to make a note about the buttons, since they’re one of the only elements of the page that incorporate the Yellow. Using a KnockOut style for the buttons was an intuitive decision and I’m really glad I chose to go with it. They look great, and they’re filled with the sense of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/file/GhJWMsF40sEEQy0M4OTAKAuj/Slackify-2018?node-id=37%3A5&quot;&gt;View the design file (created with Figma) here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coding the Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;StyleSheet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;StyleSheet&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-native&lt;/code&gt; for all the components so that each component would have its own StyleSheet. These would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;const styles = StyleSheet.create({&lt;br&gt;
emojiFormPicture: {&lt;br&gt;
flexDirection: ‘row’,&lt;br&gt;
alignItems: ‘center’,&lt;br&gt;
marginBottom: 40,&lt;br&gt;
},&lt;br&gt;
emojiForm: {&lt;br&gt;
marginTop: 100,&lt;br&gt;
width: ‘80%‘,&lt;br&gt;
},&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally wanted to use one of the naming convention standards that I had recently learned at a conference, but since the CSS here was so small I chose to go with my own naming convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, each component’s styles would begin with the name of that component, so since this is the component for the emoji page it begins with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;emoji&lt;/code&gt;. This is followed by the section name, in this case it’s the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Form&lt;/code&gt; section for the form that will post the emoji. And then finally the element name if there is one, shown is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Picture&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Custom Fonts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expo, the XDE I used to create the React Native app, has a very interesting method of installing Custom Fonts into the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;async componentDidMount() {    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   await Font.loadAsync({‘PT-Sans-Caption’: require(‘./path.ttf’),&lt;br&gt;
‘PT-Sans-Caption-Bold’: require(‘pat.ttf’),&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   this.setState({fontsLoaded: true})&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the state variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fontsLoaded&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the View would only load when the fonts are loaded. Very interesting. Check it out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/slackify/blob/master/App.js&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/a&gt; and read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@piyushgupta_81472/using-custom-fonts-in-expo-the-best-way-81f0e785580c&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Small Note&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to note one interesting thing about the CSS that I kinda hacked together. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-native&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t allow all the CSS properties and it made it difficult to create the buttons that I had designed. I actually used a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Linear Gradient&lt;/code&gt; element to reproduce the Knock Out effect desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;View style={styles.buttonContainer}&gt;  
     &lt;LinearGradient colors={\[&apos;white&apos;, &apos;white&apos;, &apos;white&apos;, YELLOW, ...  
        &lt;Text style={{fontSize: style={{fontSize: this.props.size...   
     &lt;/LinearGradient&gt;          
&lt;/View&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to pull some queasy compromises. Also in that same &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/slackify/blob/master/components/button.js&quot;&gt;button component&lt;/a&gt;, I modularized the font size to make the smaller Slack team change button easier to make. A neat trick I think to make more flexible components for easier front-end work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/slackify&quot;&gt;View all the code on Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the screenshots from my phone! I’d say the design came through really well. I was able to code up pretty exactly what I designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is still unfinished, I need to add the Slack signin API and emoji add API. But this is awesome work, and work that you can check out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Try on your device:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the expo app for &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&amp;#x26;referrer=www&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, go to the Explore section, search for Slackify and use the prototype!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Try on the web (Expo Snack):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://snack.expo.io/@askalburgi/github.com-askalburgi-slackify&quot;&gt;Go to this link!&lt;/a&gt; You’ll see all the code and be able to try out the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

… and now I carry a totally new and different perspective along with me. It’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to say “I’m not creative, I can’t do that”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message of the pictures is to respond to this, saying that you can in fact do that and be creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I learned is that the word creative is misused when people say “I’m not creative”. What they mean is, “I’m not artsy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways to be creative and we’re all creative in so many ways. Any type of organizing or critical thinking is in fact creativity. It took me a long time to learn this and I think I’m still understanding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept the word &lt;em&gt;creative&lt;/em&gt; in the captions of the pictures because I wanted to make one point not two. Too confusing otherwise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you create a better experience for something you know your users won’t want to do? What steps can the visual language take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a friendly, professional and well-designed brand and on-boarding experience for expertise input, the process of defining and contextualizing what you are good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*I4OV1G5iQLpi4Y8SgVqQXw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Got Expertise:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product set to solve &lt;strong&gt;expertise search&lt;/strong&gt;, the idea to uncover knowledge from across a company. If RJ has relevant company information about 10 year old software that only 1 current client still uses, and Nauka is brand new to the support team and gets a call from this client, how will Nauka know that RJ is the person she needs to help with her support ticket? Solving this problem could be untapping a billion dollar of monetary value in worker productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Inception:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, I thought about why users would use this product and what they’d need from it. I broke it down into 3 objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tH6V3lWYOuEIDlyoieriTw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery to try and make sure users have a great time. Professional as this would be used as an enterprise software. And fun, because fun is better (and now more acceptable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came through when thinking of moods to embrace and visual language components to feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*g7nl25N3RKCEQ0VkvWvZ7w.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Lv_3olJOEBjLPH4EHbrVnA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a professional tone is struck with minimalistic space, solid colour and light shapes. A fun tone is struck with rounded shapes, open space and energetic movement. I used these to design the brand and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mood Boarding:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client liked the safer mood board which I called “Thinking Technology”, going for the classic blue tech theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*4BYKMfONMhE9QyD9Px0X1g.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did something different with the mood boards by including a persona for the chatbot I’d be designing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persona in the Thinking Technology mood board chosen by the client was based off the Sage archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sage character archetype is driven by the need for knowledge. They’re usually the ones that are constantly asking questions and wondering why things the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This persona experiment was really fun but I’m not really sure I executed it in the final hifi’s. Creating characters and making UIs are very different skills. Interesting lesson in character development nonetheless — I’m excited for the next time I do a chatbot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Styling:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project I tried to go with 3 widely different directions for the style tile. I wanted to push myself to see completely different possibilities from the mood board above. This goal slightly backfired on me, as two of the three style tiles didn’t quite feel like fully developed pieces. They had potential though — it was a fun experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ISZoooczWQY2DFtsHZ55AQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chosen style tile was the minimalist one as shown above, aptly titled “Minimalist”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick HiFi Development:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually I go through many iterations during the final HiFi stage, but surprisingly — this design was very strong out of the gate. Their quick development helped us get back on track (we were fairly behind UI-wise) and were universally accepted from the instructors with only a few minor things requiring fixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you develop skills in a new area, sometimes it’s difficult to feel accomplished (ie imposter syndrome). Being able to knock out the HiFi’s fast and well made me feel really awesome and a worthy designer. It was a great way to end the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design language we built for Got Expertise feels clean and powerful, effective for an app about, essentially, cleaning up large bureaucratic companies and making them more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QA_9PsQnLufOfpxnP2qStw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monochromatic blue colour palette that’s both professional and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iuF_Mouby4FieqWg5ROOOA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubik type that’s got rounded corners but not too rounded, the balance is professional and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*H9KW_UN3f8L1ZWPHnA_4Pg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you create a visual language for a mobile app that must follow specific UX goals? What visual language do the users want? What feelings do the users want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a clear, goal-oriented and well-designed application around helping yoga teachers to find spaces for their classes. To find plausible business objectives to ensure viability of this product, and design for those objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uXfEfWpUTESENwaLXedg5g.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Junto:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Airbnb-like app that’s just part of the product line that would be offered to connect venue owners, yoga teachers and yoga students. A complete redesign of the yoga industry experience and financial model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally didn’t have any experience with the yoga industry, but thanks to my phenomenal group, I soon learned. That being said, we soon discovered that we never considered the implementation strategy for this business to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Inception:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junto’s most obvious visual direction is to have a kind of airy editorial. In the end, that’s what the client ended up choosing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*NeIHDnocsyomlAc1&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*XAbIM4c_eAaMJcBu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airy editorial art direction was built to appease yoga teachers. Vibrant and positive colours with open space and organic shapes. Pretty zen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7E8zxPBvkEe-R4Jh&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mood Boarding:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up mashing up two separate mood-boards into one. Our client loved the overall vibe and feeling of the &lt;strong&gt;Mind and Body&lt;/strong&gt; mood board and we added the space and visual direction of the &lt;strong&gt;Open Editorial&lt;/strong&gt; mood board to it. The editorial theme was needed for it’s heavy content-based direction, this app is also heavily content based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*iAsak-KAer2es3rTfekOtw.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*om0nFHQfvfrs_6WdtuyLlw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Styling:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*vhmVqSPWTYxWz2BdO-_wtQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the process continues, many parts of the design are subject to questioning. The style tile directions ended up forcing us to change all the colours of the app as the baby pink/blue just wasn’t working for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually these colours got changed as follows below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brighter colours reflected more positivity and was much more accurate to the vibe the client felt was needed for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7Zvy5ifuVG4QJuQIaUVEFw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stylings thus show the visual direction decisions made during the inception phase and as changes occurred. There is lots of space, powerful bursts of colour, and rounded shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*BptA-CtYajj43Wpw&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*41JpUI5QSeRQ_c92&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Few Iterations:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working as a team for this project, the work went through many different types of iterations before finally getting to the end result. There was a lot of disagreements on Android/iOS standards, font standards and more. I think utilizing Figma’s components would have helped a lot of these — but in the end the individual differences and creative freedoms is what allows for the best possible work to be produced. If only there was an easier and more objective way to figure out the synthesis of those differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design language we built for Junto feels strong but fresh, effective for an app about, essentially, freshening up the yoga industry. Users have a clean and singular experience featuring very straightforward user flows that are easy to understand for their priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, we only hifi’d user flows for the teacher portion of the app. This is because the teacher is the stakeholder that interacts with the other two stakeholders, the venue owners and students. We summarized these interactions to pain points for the yoga teacher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*wHgnWs9lPFdN4g-t&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*qXvBc7ckgZSxx6_UgefJjw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*IdDAhvHkfLaWkJKs&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*Pg-ogj4x_SjNK0Ey&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we focused on the yoga teacher, the client would unfortunately need a much better implementation strategy than just building and launching the app we designed. I recommended starting with a different app specifically for yoga studios and venues to rent in order to build relationships with that that stakeholder group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end though, Junto will connect the three stakeholders and the yoga industry will officially be tech‘ed out 🤙🏾&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you create a brand for a legal tech client? What does a legal tech brand look like? What does it feel like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new brand and website design for Legalicity, a Toronto based legal tech startup. A brand that reflects the personality of the company and suits both industries they operate in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fjI8j13EJAzv4kg8OycFLA@2x.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Legalicity:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LegalTech is an up and coming sub-industry in an industry where innovation is not a key word. Legalicity works in this difficult space, using technology and computer science to bring innovation to the industry. Currently Legalicity is working on their first product, which has it’s own website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://NLPatent.com&quot;&gt;NLPatent.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating the product and company into two websites created an information fragmentation for both sites. Visiting one leaves visitors unaware about the other, leading to Legalicity being written off. The client would not allow us to merge the two sites. This would mean that we would have to somehow connect the two sites, doing that visually would be a huge challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Inception:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legalicity’s most obvious visual direction is clean and blue. This style is common among technology company’s for it’s friendliness and trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple solution except that it wouldn’t make the Legalicity website unique to Legalicity as a company, nor would it mirror the visual from the NLPatent website. Instead, look to why Legalicity needs a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hdo04o90psYMh-NvkhYqDg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legalicity needs a website that communicates their competence in the industry and their originality as inventors. These can be brought about by using the visual elements of colour, shape, space and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mood Boarding:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to look up how blue can work with the orange of the NLPatent website. I also looked for strong shapes that resembled buildings (“city” is in the word Legalicity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uOEQEOakmidEfcqsdYURgg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mood board captures a fun energy but also a professionalism. It features sharp edges and sense of strong stability but also a lightheartedness in the colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up falling in love with the chevron shape in the moodboard and used it throughout the design process. It’s a strong and stable shape that law firms would like, but also directive and challenging that a technology startup would push for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Styling:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style tile is a representation of the visual design of the art direction and the style guide shows the technical elements of the style. They feature different elements of the app, ranging from atomic elements (font, colour, icon) to molecular elements (buttons, visualizations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x48s-1HsLoVU73ZD_CdAdQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*MQ6t_xOPU-E5uCS3kxmvgA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designs show the visual direction decisions made during the inception phase. There is the chevron shape, bright colours and the clean design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of this design is how the angles and shapes mirror that of NLPatent. There aren’t any matching elements from the two sites, but they simply feel connected thanks to the angles. It’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Than A Few Iterations:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because my goal for this project was to do a lot more design iterations, I did a lot of design iterations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*DHeWcvhskyIMECuu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*NVdCTBQfVYk-Dc6L&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*yYa3Ku3AiT-HOEiv&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first did a design blitz on sticky notes, and went over them with my team. Those were used to build a number of “above the fold” designs. Which were then honed into 3 final full web designs. Those were showed to the client who chose the “blue chevron” design. Overall I loved my process of design iterations, it worked out so well. I had some difficulty maintaining the iterations through to the final design and polishing the design towards the end but otherwise I loved this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design language I’ve built for Legalicity feels unique and modern, resembling the company at its core. Legalicity is a personable company of inventors that want to help lawyers, they’re professional but also friendly. The website is going to help lawyers understand that, and also what the company does. With this, Legalicity will be ready for it’s marketing push come September when the latest MVP is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I could have improved is justifying more of the design decisions. Being more stingy about maintaining why I’m doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filling out MLH’s Coaching Application Questionnaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Of your time in the hacker community, what are you most proud of?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time in the hacker community has been split between attending hackathons and running my own. In my second last semester of school I attended MLH hackathons all over North America and it was amazing. I ended up attending four: PennApps, MHacks, EduHacks and HackTX, as well as a weeklong trip to San Fransisco. Travelling and hacking is such a blessing and I’m really proud of myself for making the opportunity to do so. That being said, watching Edmonton’s hacking community grow over the last 3 years I’ve been running HackED has been even more special. I’ve seen students change their entire career path after attending hackathons. Giving students the realization of what their capable of is so special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is your experience as a leader in the hacker community? Do you run a club or hackathon, teach workshops, or something else?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 3 years I was the lead organizer of HackED, Alberta’s largest hackathon. I was an integral member of the organizing club, the Computer Engineering Club, which got me involved in all kinds of workshops and speaking events to represent the Faculty of Engineering and the Computer Engineering Club. In my final two years, I left the club’s executive team to allow myself more time to run events I felt were integral to the student developer community we were building but that the club didn’t have time for. I maintained my position as one of the lead organizers of the hackathon though. All three of my years as an organizer were phenomenal, I love the supportiveness of the community and I remain well connected to the Faculty of Engineering and the Computer Engineering Club so that I can continue to help/run events for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a time when you learn something new or taught someone something new. Were there any challenges? If so, what were the challenges? How did you go about overcoming those challenges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m currently taking a UI class where a lot of my fellow students are in arts. In the last five+ years I’ve never been around people that think so differently from me. At first it was a little difficult to work with them, they complained about the workload, which I didn’t find too bad after 5 years in engineering, and they often came up with bizarre conclusions about class problems. They were just so different. At the same time they were great in the design challenges our instructor gave us, thinking outside the box and creating original works where my mind could only come up with crappy remixes of stuff I found on Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after a few weeks with them was I able to begin understanding their perspective. Now I’m able to learn so much from them, and they’re able to learn from me. I showed them what it’s like to be a front end developer, copying and hacking code that we can find online, and slowly I became more artistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perspective is so important when teaching/learning. People are rarely malicious, they just have a different perspective. You have to learn their perspective to be able to communicate with them properly — learning or teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about public speaking? What was your favorite public speaking experience? Least favorite?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom enrolled me in the community public speaking contest every year throughout my childhood. I still find a lot of joy out of public speaking today, I’m a loud, energetic and motivated extrovert and it comes in handy. My most favourite public speaking experience was this past year at the Computer Engineering orientation. I spoke on how I’ve made the most of my degree (mostly via hacking) and how they can make the most of theirs. &lt;br&gt;
You can actually see the presentation here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUb8VTWUFw&amp;#x26;t=29s&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUb8VTWUFw&amp;#x26;t=29s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the worst mistake you’ve made? How did you fix it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind mistakes are difficult. If you’re able to learn from the mistake, is it really a mistake or a lesson? As time passes, they’ll always be more lesson than mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My latest worst mistake came from the result of pushing around my class schedule. I want to get the most of my time as a student so I tried to make my second last semester lighter in order to attend more hackathons. I took 2 classes out of the semester by enrolling in 2 online courses over the summer and postponed another to the final semester. With three less classes I had the best semester ever! Unfortunately, I didn’t finish the online courses over the summer. No problem, I’d do them during the semester. Didn’t happen either. By December I still hadn’t completed them, I was in panic mode. Without these classes I couldn’t graduate on time. I ended up figuring out a solution, but it led to the most difficult and stressful time of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came out of that experience feeling pretty invincible, however I feel like maintaining a better routine would be a better lesson. One that I’m still working towards!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Designing a Mobile App UI for Runnr]]></title><description><![CDATA[How do you create a visual language for a mobile app?

&lt;p&gt;How do you create a visual language for a mobile app? What does a good visual language look like? What does it feel like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create an engaging, impactful and well-designed UI Library using Sketch and the supplied wireframes. To conduct some research on Runnr and its target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*RIyFnnIaw4XXfaKu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Runnr:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A running app featuring tracking and progress, but also free music streaming. This combination allows for the ability to choose playlists based on the run; e.g. mood, pace, distance, or type of run. Runnr will keep runners on track and motivated to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don’t have any experience with running apps, but I did have experience with fitness apps in general, and based on that experience I wanted to visually play up the motivational ability of the app. That being said, my early assumption that my weightlifting apps and this running app were the same was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Inception:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runnr’s most obvious visual direction is to have the app reflect users’ chosen mood, since the user can choose a playlist based off the their mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple solution except that inconsistencies can &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mcgoldrick.kaitlyn/who-at-apple-thought-it-was-a-good-idea-to-bring-in-a-new-a-ab91f9066137&quot;&gt;confuse and/or alienate&lt;/a&gt; and thus would have to be implemented very carefully to work. Instead, look to how and why users would want to use the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MfsoyZbxnShtbOqoSZNPDw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users would want to use Runnr for tracking their stats and listening to music in one single, consistent experience. The stats will be what gives them the &lt;strong&gt;motivation&lt;/strong&gt; to further their progress and the music will help them ground and focus their &lt;strong&gt;energy&lt;/strong&gt; in their performance. These can be brought about by using the visual elements of colour, shape, space and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mood Boarding:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to look up how bright colours can be used to promote energy and motivation, and specifically in fitness apps. I also looked for round shapes and icons in app design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Nv6XH7X3AG1s1Lskw5yCLg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mood board uses a darker grey to ground the energy of the bright colours, creating an energized but calm feeling. It features a lot of round edges and space to let the energy of the colour flow throughout and around the app elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also looked for interactive app elements that I could incorporate into the app as a way to get the user to feel accomplishment as they navigate through it. I particularly fell in love with Apple’s old Swipe to Unlock, though it’s left off the mood board for it’s old design style. These interactive elements became a pain point for me later on in the design process — fleshing them out more here would have been more ideal, they created issues later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Styling:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the style tile should be a representation of the visual design of the direction, I created it, and the style guide, in the dimensions of an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both feature different elements of the app, ranging from atomic elements (font, colour, icon) to molecular elements (buttons, visualizations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*BYPaapiCQVTkNKkTZpDw2A.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*nZCjm_KhiGB_ClKF0O07wg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designs show the visual direction decisions made during the inception phase. There is lots of space, powerful bursts of colour, and rounded shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user initiated movement unfortunately took a backseat, I had struggled implementing it. While designing I realized I was missing information and tools to understand how and why users can use user initiated movement. Working without the usability and UX research made it difficult to incorporate such a unique element into visual language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I was still able to incorporate movement into the app using the arrow icon and the data visualizations. I don’t think this makes up for the original concept I had though, I’d like to learn more about the visual language of interactive elements and learn how and when to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Few Iterations:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the mood board and styling shown took a few iterations to achieve. I went through a grey phase, a hyper-gradient-rainbow phase before reaching this dark phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*EPUnvrIfFxpYwrDz&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*U8DKUHPC9g6dD9At&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*x0f2LDNmJs4w4mAs&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I liked how it came together, but I think I learned a valuable lesson in oneitis. &lt;em&gt;Don’t. Be. Attached. To. Your. Designs.&lt;/em&gt; In the future I’m going to do a design blitz (10 2 minute design sessions) in order to spark more creativity and alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design language I’ve built for Runnr feels strong and powerful, effective for an app about, essentially, control. Users have a clean and singular running experience featuring simple and easy control of their music and tracking. In the colours and space, the app communicates an energy to use that strength and power with. The clean data visualization and forward arrow iconography help to motivate runners to continue running and progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I could have improved is the microcopy of the app — it’s fairly neutral as it is and I’m interested to know how changing it’s tone would improve the experience. How would a positive tone differ from an aggressive tone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first design project as a part of the course I’m taking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/red-academy&quot;&gt;RED Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolded are terms I learned from the course and should be looked up if you want to learn too. 😇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first project of my new design course is to build a landing page for a given font. I was assigned &lt;strong&gt;Interstate&lt;/strong&gt;, the font that’s built for getting attention. In my first proper design project, I struggled process and creativity of creating art but learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;About Landing Pages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing pages are websites that are designed to “convert” it’s visitors to a sale or a further step of the sales process (email signup or start using a service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j_Sidlq3wbk9dIr1anIunw.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*YVx6KbdXc-oeRsbyTvGjNg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duolingo and Shopify are examples of the two types of landing pages, &lt;strong&gt;Click Through&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Lead Generation&lt;/strong&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My landing page is required to convert potential designers that visit the page to download the font to use in their designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;About Interstate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobias Frere-Jones created Interstate for US federal highway signage. The font was designed to be read on the road; it’s clear and legible with it’s highly discernible characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*0AVxvsuW8q2w8mmb2bJdbg.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*rj2GShc-m3_rGyv6Cgkpcw.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*t879NoXAN2HhCzoVhqAXWQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interstate itself is pretty unique as a font. It has a highly versatile font family in that the lighter fonts and the heavier fonts can be used in nearly any case. Using either lighter and heavier variants, Interstate can be used in &lt;strong&gt;font pairings&lt;/strong&gt; in any use (header text, body text, etc). This feature can be used to create contrast, exemplifying the purpose of Interstate, to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Inception to Visual Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a &lt;strong&gt;design inception sheet&lt;/strong&gt; to lead me to a &lt;strong&gt;visual language&lt;/strong&gt; for my landing page. To build a landing page that communicates the purpose of interstate, I thought about the moods necessary to showcase that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S4C55b9XsuYrra4WHu89CA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get attention, Interstate can use it’s versatility. Interstate can feel calm, unique, subtle, strong, simple or clear. To do that, I need to create some type of contrast with the visual language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to keep the focus on movement based on cars and roadways, using the lack of the other three elements (colour, shape and space) to build the contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mood Boarding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these elements in mind, I created two mood boards using Pinterest. The mood boards helped me get inspiration for designs and learn more about can be possible with the visual language I want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*uz3PhsXJ-HuamVdgGnb-Wg.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*nyecQyjDk2wpn2eIx4cDmg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left board is designed after a chill road trip, after all Interstate was made for freeways. I loved the simplicity and associated calmness from the topology graphics. The right board keeps with the road motif but goes into the city. The beauty and stillness of the busy city shots really fit with my desired visual language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Style Tile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mood boards are quite vague, so &lt;strong&gt;style tiles&lt;/strong&gt; are used to help capture the mood from the mood board but are laid out in a more useful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*pk838ykP61GPYRb1EaNX7Q.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*CfOIsEttnMLYzSX6q8uUuA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “night in the city” tile captures the mood much better, but I liked the idea behind the topology better and chose to go forward with it instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mockups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t properly create a mockup at first using the style tile as a mockup instead, a mistake. The photoshop layout messed up my visual process, originally the design was more like a poster than a website. I think doing this part of the project better (including mood board elements of website designs) would have significantly helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5PHJlw_j3Cj3YfwcQDmX0w.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final mockup, some of it shown above, was created after looking at other websites for inspiration of web elements and getting some inspiration from my instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nv0RaslfjoC47CUeUYmNkA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result still had much of a poster design and doesn’t convey any visual language at all. On top of that it doesn’t really bring much attention to the font either. I have a long way to go as both a designer and artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about both from this project. This was the first time I had ever used mood boards and it shows — they are too vague. I feel that if I took more time to explain the visual language from the design inception, it would have carried into the mood board and through all the way to the final design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I tried to do a lot of the project slightly off-board from the process suggested to us and got burned bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that by following the process better and working harder on visual language (and finding inspiration for it) I can do much better in future projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually I’ve already been improving! Check out my github for all my design work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solo trips are scary. They’re a full send on getting you out of your comfort zone. They’re always described as “finding yourself” or “discovery” because you’re putting yourself in an uncomfort zone and you force yourself to grow because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solo trip was not scary. It wasn’t an uncomfort zone. It wasn’t even on the edge of my comfort zone, it was smack dab in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m too extroverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got there I immediately started meeting people by playing basketball in the park, talking to people at malls and coffee shops and adding everyone I met on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heV5yUua1VQhAY42yVXKV8_q9qNzwAI0GQ/preview&quot; title=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heV5yUua1VQhAY42yVXKV8_q9qNzwAI0GQ/preview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjun goes to play basketball in the park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heV5yUua1VQhAY42yVXKV8_q9qNzwAI0GQ/preview&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This realization really clicked for me when I did open mic stand up, (almost) impromptu, 4 days into my trip. I was so unfazed when walking back to the hostel after my 5 minutes that I just knew I was still well in my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of my trip I tried to think about what my uncomfort zone is and how I can grow to get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think that’s for another post. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say, I just love food…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k3x4eNfGaG54H9skwyKeSA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time over the last 8 months, I realized Edmonton has a lot to offer in terms of restaurants. After a few interesting spots were introduced to me I decided to try not to attend a restaurant twice, in order to help encourage me to try new places instead of settling for the same ones over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all put into high gear after a friend introduced me to her list, which I’d jokingly call &lt;em&gt;the rad list&lt;/em&gt;. After sharing this long (80 places!) list with a few people I started getting really annoyed at all the scrolling and Googling I had to do. So I decided to build a website out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3A1c7OFEVCFWX-nwayHYdQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original idea for the site would be a simple list of all the restaurants with some searchable features to find restaurants faster and quick links to Google Maps and review websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true main goal of the site was to practice up on my design skills. Of all the websites I’ve built, I personally don’t think I’ve really pushed myself to build something with a first class design. I wanted to build something stunning and timeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qpA9S3RtIxE9IP9Iwa-mBQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve graduated school, finances have become a priority. I’ve decided to attempt to turn TheRadList into something that can earn me a passive income by featuring ads and selling review placement to restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, the original concept of the site needs to be adjusted slightly in order to better satisfy the two user groups. Users of the site need to have a delightful and valuable experience in order to keep visiting and share with their friends. Restaurants and advertisers need to be shown value by numbers of users and proper marketing on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited to see where this will go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of writing this, I need to work on more filters and get more restaurants on the site.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Asking a peer to explain a concept is a simple example of learner-initiated conversation and an effective learning technique, but it is difficult to automate for many different users and topics. Research on conversational agents generally keeps to conversations of a more specific domain. In this paper, a learner-initiated conversational agent is introduced; it can converse with many users (one at a time) and is capable of discussing many topics. This poster presents this agent’s development with a specific focus on using conversational practices to help support informal learning experiences. The agent uses Wikipedia as a first step in the development of a flexible and mobile conversation-based learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; E-learning, Conversational Agent, Wikipedia, Self-directed learning, Mobile learning, Informal learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Introduction and Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking a peer to explain a concept is a simple example of a learner-initiated conversation that occurs naturally. This type of learning relies on a peer to have sufficient knowledge of the topic, which is not always the case. Automating the conversation means understanding the user’s goal and the user’s requested topic, for any user and any topic. The ultimate goal of this project is to create an automated educational experience that is useful and context-dependent, just like that of conversing with a peer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing agents create and research experiences modelled after conversing with a tutor (Nye and Graesser and Hu, 2014). These agents are designed to help users with specific knowledge areas and under specific circumstances, but utilize concepts of dialog, interaction and natural language understanding (NLU) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-31546-001&quot;&gt;Katz and Albacete, 2013&lt;/a&gt;) that are applicable to any agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project builds a prototype e-learning agent that attempts to explore the requirements of the desired experience. The prototype is built as a command line interface (CLI) and focuses specifically on the context and dialogue of the conversational experience. Content is supplied to the agent from Wikipedia so that a large number of topics can be covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Existing Conversational E-Learning Agents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversational agents are still far from achieving human-like dialogue (&lt;a href=&quot;http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N13/N13-1098.pdf&quot;&gt;Thomason and Litman&lt;/a&gt;, 2013) despite researchers actively pursuing this goal. Dialog has been used to simulate the highly interactive nature of human tutoring (&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-31546-001&quot;&gt;Katz and Albacete, 2013&lt;/a&gt;), in specific domains where the conversational agent or tutoring system control most of the learning experience. However, it has been shown that there is no one size fits all language model to be used for such tutoring (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7756915/&quot;&gt;Katz and Jordan and Albacete, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Conversational agents that help students learn by holding a conversation in natural language (Nye and Graesser and Hu, 2014) have been explored but conversations that are student-initiated have not. Existing agents ask students to explain topics, this project has the agent explaining topics from Wikipedia so the user can ask further questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;E-learning Dialog Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conversational prototype was built from an iterative, design-based research perspective. The prototype features three parts: prompting, briefly summarizing, and conversing with the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3.1. &lt;strong&gt;Building Context using Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system needs to understand the goals of the user to have an appropriate conversation. These goals are the user’s context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia offered an approach to building this context with its large MediaWiki topology and consistently structured entries. Narrowing and filtering of information to satisfy the learner’s goals can be done by traversing the topology and scanning through the entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both depth-first (i.e., choosing a Wikipedia page and exploring its content) and breadth-first (i.e., viewing the Wikipedia page in the topology, as it connects to other pages) explorations of the Wikipedia knowledge base were considered. To decide between these approaches, we conducted exploratory user evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Testing.&lt;/strong&gt; The prompt, “what would you like to learn”, was used to start a discussion and observe the type of knowledge the discussion centered around. Centering around a specific topic signified depth-first interest, and centering around relations between topics signified breadth-first interest. A few college students were briefly asked the prompting question at a hackathon. The discussions displayed depth-first interest, thus the project continued using depth-first conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3.2. &lt;strong&gt;Creating the Agent with the Wikipedia API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia API libraries were used to retrieve the information and metadata from a Wikipedia page for the agent to use. A search query helped identify a Wikipedia topic for the learner and a nested list implementation of a page’s sections and subsections was useful in leading the conversation to more specific information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although conversations at this stage were possible, the text retrieved from the sections is too large and lacked conversational flow. To improve the conversation, the text needed to be summarized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3.3. &lt;strong&gt;Creating Natural Conversation with the PyTeaser API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews were conducted to better understand how the agent should create summaries and handle questions the learner may have afterwards. These 10 interviews were modelled after the existing prototype and were performed on college students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extractive query focused summaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Interviewers would summarize large text blocks using the visual and vocal feedback they received to ensure the conversation remained relevant to the interviewee. This model is called a query-focused summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyTeaser API was used to provide this type of summary in the prototype. The query was set to the subtopic title itself. This helped to create smaller, focused responses by the agent. However, like many other extractive summarization algorithms (&lt;a href=&quot;http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/N/N10/N10-1133.pdf&quot;&gt;Ceylan and Mihalcea and Ozertem and Lloret and Palomar, 2010&lt;/a&gt;), PyTeaser’s results were often too long for them to be appropriate responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-summary follow-up questions.&lt;/strong&gt; During the interviews, follow-up questions were asked to help learners accomplish their learning goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follow-up questioning was added to the agent after the summarization stage. Once the learner replies with his/her question, the agent responds by re-summarizing the topic, using keywords from the question as the query. Unfortunately the summarization again relied on PyTeaser, possibly bringing more confusion than help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3.4. &lt;strong&gt;Improving Conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Concepts from Summarization.&lt;/strong&gt; The agent can use NLU techniques to find keywords and concepts to help build a summary, similar to what the interviewer would do. The agent uses the IBM Watson NLU API (Watson) to retrieve concepts from the user’s response to help provide more data to the query focused summarizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nested Subtopic Summarization.&lt;/strong&gt; Interviewers would include subsection headers when summarizing subtopics that had their own subsections. This helped interviewers build more context as to where the conversation should go. To replicate this within the agent, an additional summarization function was made using the same technique from Watson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-Ended Questioning Upon Exit.&lt;/strong&gt; If interviewers felt that they had failed to deliver the information the participating learner was seeking, they would simply ask if that was the case. This sparked another conversational flow for the interviewer to try to accomplish the learner’s goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this usually happened after the learner motioned for the interview to end, the agent asks similar questions at the end of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many possible paths the prototype could take to further explore the potential for learner-initiated conversational agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two APIs, PyTeaser and Watson, did not solve the original problem in most cases. Output could still be too long and lack conversational flow. Although the use of PyTeaser and Watson was serviceable for this stage of the prototype, both need to use context better to support real learning conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the project would benefit from being able to distinguish between conversations that meet or failed to meet the user’s learning goal. This type of metric would provide data that can be analyzed to improve the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype agent built shows the potential for learner-initiated conversations that are relevant and knowledgeable. Interviews helped establish the dialog and content of these conversations while NLU techniques helped were used to enable agent-learner conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exploration has the potential to be expanded on. The agent built is currently only able to discuss topics at a high level, but developing context-dependent summarization and more finely-tuned dialog would continue the exploration into deeper educational discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I organized my third and final HackED, I can’t even explain how weird it is to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember naming it HackED with my friend Brittany back in 2015, I participated in that one (where I made ShoutBox). HackED 2015 had some 60 students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend there was some 170 students at the opening ceremonies, tripling the participants in 3 years. We featured workshops, HackED branded t-shirts and stickers, trivia prizes, and more. We have a dedicated team that continues to refine the structure of the event while also supporting more participants than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember every single event of how we came to this point. And to be honest, none of them are grand. I think that’s what growth really is, natural change over time. It’s only when you look back do you see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And damn, I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Bjt2NwoxVm5Y1RzdXhfTvw.png&quot; alt=&quot;growthman&quot;&gt;
growthman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see where it’ll grow next. Hopefully I’ll be there the whole way (probably 😛)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Feeling of Focus]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sitting at my desk.

&lt;p&gt;A friend just messaged me. I have a lot of tabs open. I’m also working on my assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear the music on in my room, I see my clothes, I feel the heater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door is closed but I know my roommates are cooking in the kitchen, watching the basketball game too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a dog barking outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at my desk. My laptop in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working on my assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New.” is becoming the title of my trimester series lololol I’ll go with it. My life is split by trimester, and each one I try to focus on something else, something… New. This is New, new years 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last trimester was so much fun, it was me living life to the fullest. Philly, Detroit, Vancouver, Austin, Calgary, San Francisco, Toronto were the places. Hacking, wedding crashing, networking, starting shit, late nights were the happenings. What an incredible time. So many blessings shone on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first trimester of 2018 is back to my life as a machine. I used to be so dedicated. So much more focused. So studious. So I’ll welcome the strict routines and hard work. From diet to school work to learning to doing. Breaking the old habits will be very difficult of course, but I want that lifestyle back, I need that back actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this is my last semester in school. I ended up offloading a lot of tough work to this trimester. And because of it, the work and stress has been mounting on my shoulders. To be honest, I’m terrified and afraid. I’m so scared that I won’t be able succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pressure makes diamonds, I guess. Onto 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I walked around Toronto, the same streets I walked around three and a half years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*WoeWMNVfl0bQ5N18XPgmRA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories flooded back like watching ghosts. “Here’s the bank I deposited my first Developer earnings in”, “Here’s where I had my first beer”, “Here’s where I bought the earmuffs I’m wearing right now!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I saw the people too. From the professionals that walk with their heels and nice coats to the students and other people that wander the city, everyone here has a purpose and they dress for it. It looks so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vibe left a major impression on me three and a half years ago. I completely changed my wardrobe after that summer, and a year later I was wearing slacks and a collar nearly every day. I had a look thanks to Toronto. I cared about my image thanks to Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I find myself in a similar situation. I don’t have a look, I don’t know what I’m dressing for everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to change that, and I think I will now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Toronto, you again are the city that keeps building me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to a friend later about confidence and how important it is. The conversation continued to moving on from your stressors and self-help. I realized this post contains more meaning than I originally assigned to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post is about how I only stress out over the things that will happen in the future. I spend my energy worrying about how things will work out as opposed to how things already happened. That’s a really good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it would be better to stress out only about the things we can control (which is a subset of the things that will happen in the future). But it’s a step :) I just wanted to share this little proud moment of realization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, more pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey pretty boy, time to check in &amp;#x3C;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any insecurity in particular consistently coming to mind?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did I do this week that made me feel happy/fulfilled/proud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about what a value you want to do better with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask myself these questions twice a week. I’ve been pretty impressed with how they work as a mental health check,because they’re so good at making me aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mental health right now is the lowest it’s been all year. I’m stressed beyond belief, there is so much on my plate and not a lot of immediate people present to lean emotional baggage on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it was really tough to answer the questions. In a high stress mode, you don’t think about insecurities, or what you’re happy/proud of. And what I want to do better is… everything… what a terrible answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know what, I’m aware of it. And that let’s me problem solve. Mental health, managed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unique]]></title><description><![CDATA[What makes me unique?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes me unique?&lt;/strong&gt; Prompted by DevFacto application form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k3x4eNfGaG54H9skwyKeSA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I started my degree in engineering, my cousin Krisna (PhD. at USC) shared with me a small secret. He told me the trick to problem solving is to learn from multiple domains, this way you can cross reference the knowledge from one, to solve problems in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been nearly five years since then, and looking back on my projects I can see that his advice has really come through. Alluded to in my cover letter, I’m always looking to learn and I’m always looking for problems to solve, and new ways to solve those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My willingness to keep looking and ability to cross reference what I learned and the problems I see is what makes me unique. Really unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Slackify — only after understanding project management would I be able to see how great a benefit good team bonding and morale can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or LOGN — being able to use UX practices like metrics, interviewing and iteration cycles helped me greatly improve LOGN over the 3 weeks I was in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some problems are easy, but other problems are hidden. It takes a lot of practice to be able to solve problems, but it takes a lot of learning to be able to see problems too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question prompted by Electric City Hacks application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k3x4eNfGaG54H9skwyKeSA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why I am proud of it, the obstacles I had to overcome, learning points, where I see the project going in the future…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two definitions of the word student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;denoting someone who is studying in order to enter a particular profession&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;a person who takes an interest in a particular subject&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our industrialized education system is built to optimize only 1 of these definitions (hint: it’s the first one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always hated that. Why can’t I be a student by the second definition?! I want to explore my interest, and have multiple interests, and let those interests guide my education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of deliberating, I’ve finally started working on a project. I want to make an AI that helps users explore and discover their interests, teaching users about topics they have interest in. It’s the project I’m most proud of because it’s the project I feel is the most important, the freedom of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has two iterations so far, the second building on the difficulties of the previous. The most recent prototype has simple chat + graph interfaces that effectively show minimum viability that the project can work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be done on the knowledge graph backend and the usability/design of the front end — all of which I have yet to learn. The next iteration will work towards creating a knowledge graph with the information and relations necessary to fuel the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of this project is truly enormous, and I doubt I’ll be able to turn it into a fully fledged product anytime soon. But I’m still immensely proud that I’m taking it on and learning as much as I can. I’m stunned at my own motivation to learn — which is proof that the second definition listed above deserves more attention paid towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question prompted by Granify job application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I not say ShoutBox? It’s my first ever hackathon project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout high school, I was very inspired by how Google could use technology to assist and improve lives. But I didn’t have the slightest idea that I could go ahead and do those things myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a summer coding with my cousin and one term of Computer Engineering completed, I was prompted to attend the Computer Engineering Club’s hackathon. While wondering about an idea, I was given a simple premise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What’s a problem or annoyance you see in your everyday life? Fix it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always found it extremely annoying how people would take their phones out of their pocket to tweet instead of using the laptop that’s right in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry (teamed up with me for the hackathon) and I built a Chrome extension that sped up users’ ability to tweet from their laptop. With the hope that bettering the experience on their laptop would stop users from wasting time going to their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry and I won third place, but more importantly it gave me the drive to use my powers for more than just being a code monkey. For the rest of my life, I want to solve problems that assist and improve lives — all thanks to ShoutBox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this trimester, I’m preparing to go to 5 hackathons. Including organizing &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackedbeta.compeclub.com&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, that’s 6 hackathons I’m involved with in a 4 month period. Why?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I first started my degree, I told myself the two most important things for me to do are to learn as much as I can and to build technology that enabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I went through a boring and unfulfilling year at school. Classes were lecture style, where I would fall asleep, and I barely built anything that I was truly passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t live like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refuse to live like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I’m spending time and money on myself. Hackathons are for &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; development and for &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; wellbeing. I’m having the greatest time of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t believe it took me four years and one month to finally figure out my most preferred style. This is something I’ve strived to learn about myself for years, and finally learning it now means I’m going to run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization came thanks to a new course I’m taking, ECE 406. It’s a research class, meaning that I’m supposed to learn on my own time with weekly meetings with my supervisor. The course has been getting more and more prevalent in my mind since the beginning of classes, with my registration finally being processed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My supervisor sent me the course description and goals for me yesterday. I’m to build a chatbot that helps users learn. The scope and boundaries of the project are yet to be defined, but this newfound direction was enough for me to immediately go off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first began by reading about Education + AI. What’s already happening? What’s needed? I found a great article from MIT professor Dr. Woolfe that gave me an understanding of what I needed to include in the project to facilitate learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly decided I needed to know more about the resources I have on campus and around Edmonton, I sent out a few emails which have already come back and resulted in a few meetings with people that can help guide my project. Both people I’ve yet to meet, and people I have met before. I’ve known that people and learning from people is one of my strengths, but it now has new meaning with the context and goal of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also began researching chatbot APIs and knowledge graphs to use this weekend at mHacks. I decided that I’ll use my hack this weekend to give me a jumpstart into my project, learning things about actually building the thing that I can use to build from. The ML capabilities of my laptop are not strong enough for the project, but they’ll be fine for the hack where I’ll stub an API (or a few) in place of where my own learning engine would be. The hack will be a great place to test the user facing side of the project and figuring out what the scope of the project should be and what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m currently writing with so much passion and energy despite it being midnight. I can tell that I’ve really found how to hack my brain into learning and I can’t wait to retest this with other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadline + Mission + Network + Hackathon. Let’s see if the formula is bigger.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cycle of Mentorship]]></title><description><![CDATA[Where would you be without mentors?

I don’t even want to imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout high school I was always involved in clubs, and after stepping away from it in first year, maybe I wanted to get back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was transitioning between friend groups at the time. Maybe I felt like I would find good friends through CompE Club?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I knew, that the 5th year students had something to teach me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re the people that helped me set up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arjunkalburgi.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and launch my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://connectfour275.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; back in 2014. And even in 2017 they’re the people that teach me &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/tick-tack-toe&quot;&gt;ReactJS&lt;/a&gt;, give me advice and tell me stories. 3 years later I still maintain connections with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking about this now, because now I’m the 5th year student. It’s weird to think that I can be that 5th year presence while still being me. I’m forever a student in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I spoke at CompE orientation, to all the new second year CompE’s. I told them a lot of the things and stories that my mentors told me, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My presentation at CompE Orientation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already got tons of emails from these students asking for advice on how to start and where to look and what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the questions have been pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT IT’S JUST ME&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m that same kid from 2014, I’m not sure I could answer the same questions I asked back then. But I am sure that I’ll do my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on the other side, being a mentor, is a new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*53lPEky3ithWRORA9eP8Ug.png&quot; alt=&quot;Let’s see. Lol.&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean is that I’m an engineering student that can fix my own depressive lulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last semester I went through a depressive lull. I call it a lull because it wasn’t exactly depression, the word is already over-diluted, but I was definitely down, off, miserable, lost — for like a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t help that my solution to my mood issue couldn’t be made in effect until this year, five months later. I was not in a good mental state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I went to Iceland for 3 weeks, and spent the following 4 months in my mom’s home (emphasis on &lt;em&gt;mom’s&lt;/em&gt;, ❤).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re now only two weeks into the school year, and already I can tell my solution is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve completely diversified the amount of people and projects I spend time with. I spent quality time with people in person, and roll with my busy schedule as I make it more busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sooooo proud of myself. But I’m not content, I guess that’s growth mindset for ya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slackify, created at PennApps XVI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always trying to look out for tips and tricks to improve the productivity and speed of my organizing teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being as involved as I am, the little things can make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?mcubz=0&quot;&gt;Google study&lt;/a&gt; that found teams can be more productive if they share personal details and maintain good morale with each other. Ever since I’ve been trying to find ways to use that knowledge to make my own teams better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two summers ago, I found an example of the knowledge in use (whether intentionally or not, I’m not sure) at my summer employeer iQmetrix. They loved Slack and their graphic designer loved making custom Slack emoji’s of everyone in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were emoji’s of people winking, dancing and all manners of playing around, and it did wonders for bonding and morale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following school year I had to try it out. When someone took a picture of me sleeping in the clubroom, I slapped the Computer Engineering Club logo on it and uploaded them as custom emojis: &lt;em&gt;compeforehead&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;compecheeks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IyPH6bwKqQru95sHfHOoeQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were a huge hit with the team and helped cement a culture of using emoji’s to react and reply to messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Michelle graduated that year and messaged me over the summer describing how she missed that culture. Even remembering &lt;em&gt;compecheeks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*w00r4-uSV_jDSRit.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I want to take the use of custom emoji’s to the next level, and hopefully I can do that with Slackify, created at PennAppsXVI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slackify is an Expo app that allows users to choose/take photos which then get resized to emoji dimensions perfect for uploading to Slack. With this app, a team can quickly grow their custom emoji index with all manner of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to find out how turning a moment into a &lt;em&gt;meme for the team&lt;/em&gt; is taken by my slack team. I’m optimistic it’ll be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was originally posted in July 2016 on my old blog. It’s something I’ve been thinking about lately as I’ve been working on the mission again. Good read :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My New Mission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one thing that Tech companies around the world don’t know about my University’s Computer Engineering [CE] program…. &lt;em&gt;we produce good computer engineers&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my involvements with the CE Club, I realized that the Club doesn’t have the time to help create a positive perception and the benefits of such a perception can go a long way. This year I am taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brittany (the former Club President) and myself have already put much thought into this. We have concluded that not enough of our peers are creating an online presence for themselves to be noticed by companies and that their knowledge on how to make themselves attractive is very limiting (the Faculty of Engineering [FoE] is partly at fault for this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brittany and I believe that with our peers individually making themselves more attractive, a natural, organic and correct perception will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan comes in two levels firstly to educate our peers — how can they become more attractive? — and secondly to help them make themselves attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To educate them, we have been working with the Engineering Employment Centre [EEC] of the FoE to put on workshops on how computer engineers can create a good online brand for themselves. Brittany and I sat down with EEC in early May 2016 to tell them what our peers need — Github (and projects), website, resume advice and social media advice. Throughout the year, EEC will put on free workshops to teach our peers what they need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help them along, Brittany and I plan to host weekly “Coding Parties” where we can establish mentor-mentee relationships to guide students on establishing their online brand and to help them with their own projects/theory/schoolwork. The Coding Parties will help create a community amongst CE as well, which will help raise the status of CE within the University — which has it’s own benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is the official plan I have with Brittany, I’m also working on another wrinkle as well. I am pushing the Club to recreate its own brand so it can establish itself as the main contact for companies to get involved with computer engineers instead of having companies get involved through individuals. Having the Club as the main contact will help maintain sustained success after individuals leave as a natural passing-of-the-torch will keep those contacts alive for future years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have to see :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New.2]]></title><description><![CDATA[The more I think I know about design, the more I know I don’t know.

What a punch to the ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve built a lot of confidence in the past year with my design skills, but after finally speaking with my design friends and trying new things, I still have a long way to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New.2 is my website, now nearly complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*w_QAKp0pVQRNo54e5ZWotw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized after discussing with Jeph yesterday that my website isn’t the frontier of my online brand, but the place for randoms and people who don’t know me. It’s for the HR lady at the company I applied to, for the high school student preparing for a networking event. My real brand is on the platforms I contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why my new website doesn’t have content on it, simply featuring the “meme” version of my logo on a simple canvas, a description of my purpose, links to those platforms, and direct links to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website isn’t live just yet, but here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/askalburgi/askalburgi.github.io/tree/websiteAug2017Curr&quot;&gt;github preview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*loZCt_22h4iM0C3hYmv10Q.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striving for better engagement has led me to develop applications, learn interaction design and practice my charisma. Striving for actions has led me into some great projects, including a trip to Iceland and a hackathon for high school students. Striving for altruism and empathy has led me to become a better leader — one that cares about the people I lead and the people I try to benefit. Striving for growth means meticulously analyzing how I can be better, a trait that fuels the other three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees are great, they grow bigger, they engage with the elements, they act on the challenges they face — growing regardless of what’s in their way, and they show so much compassion for the living things around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things I strive for, the values I make every decision with. But I’m no tree, I’m still starting. So imma leaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about some of the things he said since I spoke at Big Idea Camp a few weeks ago. One of the reasons is, my old triangle logo wasn’t cutting it. It didn’t represent me, or what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s in with that newnew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strongest traits, the ones those closest to me will understand are my dedication towards growth, action, engagement and altruism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of becoming a maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ENGFDsKdRgxpl91gJC8a7w.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my second year at the University of Alberta, the Computer Engineering Club was coming off year one of the new culture. The then executive was looking to build and connect a new community from the ground up. Part of that effort took form in the hackathon, now known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://hacked.compeclub.com&quot;&gt;HackEd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same executive loved to code and make things together. They were hackers, and encouraged me to do the same. I remember I could always find certain members in certain places working on certain projects together. But the projects themselves were what really what had my attention. These guys built stuff that &lt;em&gt;did things&lt;/em&gt;, and did things &lt;em&gt;for people&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ENGFDsKdRgxpl91gJC8a7w.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same year I participated in that same hackathon, my first, at that time it didn’t even have a name. I teamed up with my friend Harry to build ShoutBox, a Google Chrome extension that allows you to tweet from the address bar. I had seen many of my friends pull out their phones to tweet despite being in front of their laptop, the desktop experience wasn’t good enough. ShoutBox would solve this problem with a relatively simple solution. Harry and I walked into the 24 hours with the plan that we’d learn how to create a Chrome extension, set up a log in with Twitter, and post user’s tweets. This plan quickly changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Harry and I configured most of the Chrome Extension, I began to start the oauth handshake with Twitter. After many attempts, I determined that it was impossible — thanks to some older students helping us, we learned that it was because the Chrome Extension is not a valid endpoint. Harry and I then went into crazy troubleshooting mode, where for the next 5–6 hours we tried every possible way to get the tweet from the Extension to Twitter (even email). Eventually one of the older students saw us struggling at 5am and suggested a Node.js server, of which we knew nothing about at the time. Under a very tight deadline, we learned the Javascript required to set up the Node server but without enough time to get the Twitter oauth working. As a temporary fix we stole our oauth keys from the Twitter Developer page and turned our attention to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hackathon, presentation is everything; knowing this and that everyone would be tired after the 24 hours, we set up our presentation to bring lots of energy and excitement and use our loud personalities to our advantage. We demonstrated ShoutBox’s speed and conveyed the usability and friendliness of the interface. We ended up presenting last, and our presentation picked up the energy of the room; our booming voices and excitement in our own product got the judges excited enough to award us third place at the competition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*eywW2ZPV3xutxCua.&quot; alt=&quot;Harry and I after being awarded 3rd place&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That summer I went back to our work to redo the project properly. I implemented the Node server better, creating a website as an additional user interface for the oauth with Twitter, and upgraded the design to be cleaner and more simple. Finally, I put the application onto a Heroku server and made the Extension available on the Chrome Web Store. It was a real and great experience creating something from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the hackathons I attended went as well as this first one, but this experience definitely set the tone for my goals and expectations since. Looking back at this project two years later, I still have the drive to create for people and continue to implement it in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@askalburgi/building-for-people-blindglasses-c6dbd9e6f9a7&quot;&gt;recent projects&lt;/a&gt;, I still reap the great benefits of being encouraged to hack by peers and I still have so much to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building for people requires Design as much as Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ENGFDsKdRgxpl91gJC8a7w.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a writeup for HackTheNorth2017 application, answering the question — what recent project are you most proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love creating great experiences, this can take a lot of shapes as there are a lot of ways to go about it. Over the last year my interest has really focused on UX, how can I use technology to make people’s experience better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last March my friend Harry and I went to nwHacks with the plan to make sunglasses that gave visual context for the blind. The glasses would be equipped with a camera connected to a Pi, and would read out the contents of the photo to the wearer using recognition APIs from Google and Microsoft, as well as a neural net we made on IBM Watson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project was a huge hit, we won third at the competition and a lot of participants approached us saying they thought we should have gotten first or second. Many people loved that we were doing something for the disabled community and many more were impressed with the way we combined together multiple API responses to be read to the user (and honestly it was so difficult).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DiYYJ_KRAY1jDjIbgSmnaQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;At nwHacks, Harry wearing the glasses&quot;&gt;
At nwHacks, Harry wearing the glasses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to me the best part of our hack was the design of the glasses. We embedded the camera in the plastic of the sunglasses and used a touch sensor instead of a button for picture taking. These choices helped make the wearable extremely minimal, with even the wires tucked behind the wearers ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at comparable glasses online, they’re all extremely large and weird-looking. Our glasses were designed to look normal and would hopefully help it’s wearer feel more comfortable. As one who loves to create great experiences, this is what made me the most proud. Hopefully I’ll get to work on more projects like this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

This review seeks to analyse how Canadian banks convey the security of their software to users. In today’s world, and going forward, it is imperative that users are made aware of how the software they use protects them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick summary of what’s to come:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is Security UX? What we are looking for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBC Mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scotiabank Mobile Banking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TD Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIBC Mobile Banking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A banking app with good security UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Security UX is important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each section will have a small tldr for a quick summary :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Security UX? What we are looking for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world bombarded with bad security, as a company you want to ensure your users that your security will keep them safe. But how do you communicate that? Especially since security is notorious for boring users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good UX and design can improve security in several ways. First, by improving users awareness where things are unsecure (think Google’s HTTPS warnings). Second, by prompting users to make more secure choices. And third, by making users know how they’re being protected. These all contribute to Security UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this review, we will be looking for these cases of Security UX in the onboarding process of four Canadian banking applications: RBC, Scotiabank, TD and CIBC. To make it more fun, we’ll approach each app under the guise that we’re a user looking for a faster and more seamless banking solution but are concerned about its security. In other words, we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use the app, but we also want to know if it’s safe. This means we will walk-through the app trying to make the most secure decisions possible and looking for more information on the app’s security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; Security UX is using design to make users feel and be safer. This review goes through the onboarding of the RBC, Scotiabank, TD and CIBC banking apps looking for how the app asks us to make decisions about our security and how the app makes us aware of how we’re protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RBC Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting: we are a user looking to do cool things with the RBC Mobile app, but we also want to make sure it’s safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These screenshots were taken with a Nexus 5 which does not have a finger print sensor, so additional security features offered by RBC’s app regarding the finger print sensor were not captured here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Walk-through&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*99L4a3eWiUEZuQ76PF7ZXA.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*vEMdJ5iuKWIqEkEQScT_RA.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*lH3gL0RYVGJPf7ioRRJf4w.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application opens to a onboarding panes of how the app can be used. I thought it was very interesting that the first screen of the app exclaims that you don’t have to sign in to check your balance. At this point, eyebrow raised, but as a user that really wants to use the app, I’ll continue on. I skipped screenshots of the middle panes but at this point I’m pretty excited to get started. Upon dismissing the onboarding panes the user is given a list of decisions, but curious to find out more about the app’s security I’ll go exploring first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*R_Rw9R_50lGxxIZcl0ZnWg.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*TbDcij_uyPRoJ3O_1a5qjw.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*6xxzd7tfP_uDl0o10asR9A.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The button overlapping the image to the right of the screen, scrolls down to show the Account Preview where we’re prompted to sign in again (even though we were totally told we didn’t have to sign in earlier). Closing that, the hamburger menu in the top left opens to a list of features offered by the app. One of those (not shown) is “Privacy and Security”, this is what we’re looking for! It opens to a webview of RBC’s Privacy and Security webpage which has all the necessary information for what we’re looking for but hiding the information this way is not good security UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*oRxcOo0gXj3wo5CAjavwJg.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*K6vx0MLKFLzzoPq3SVR5vg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go ahead and sign in now, where the app prompts a verification question! This is an example of opinionated design, users are not given options of which way they can provide verification, nor are given a choice of which verification question to answer. Assuming this question is randomly selected each sign in, this is good security UX. (That being said, I realize that security questions themselves aren’t very good at providing security, but it’s the UX that matters in this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk-through tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of UX making users make good security decisions, the app using very opinionated design on log in is good security UX. In terms of UX making users aware, the app flops. Users need to understand the risks and the work being done to mitigate those risks — the app hiding this information in the back is no good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning panes are a great way to talk about security because it forces concise copy and graphics to assist comprehension. I would add a pane for security, something short and sweet that links to more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current design is built on the premise that you can see different things in different places. This is to make a user’s experience with the app quick and brief. I respect that design choice, but I think that it doesn’t belong in the onboarding flow. User’s need to understand that the app can handle different assets with different security measures and the current design does not handle this well. It would make a lot more sense to have a general sign in to your “main account”, giving you access to Quick View and RBC Royal Bank sections, and allow for explorations into other assets later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RBC tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; Design choices made in this app do not prioritize security enough, though some effort is made by being very opinionated upon actual sign in. Additionally, design of the app in general is messy. That being said, it can be very easy to change the current design to be more concise and to emphasize security more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scotiabank Mobile Banking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting: we are a user looking to do cool things with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scotiabank.mobile%5C&quot;&gt;Scotiabank Mobile Banking&lt;/a&gt; app, but we also want to make sure it’s safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These screenshots were taken with an iPhone which does have a finger print sensor, so additional security features offered by Scotiabank’s app regarding the finger print sensor are expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Walk-through&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*7dRAcaqoBg2bJxfF7_KxoQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*kwr_ynuCJ_ByJfVLnaD9Og.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*JGLPfLUbKWyHUNBMCVOW_A.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application opens to this mess of a screen; seven buttons, 3 of them not able to convey their purpose, one toggle and only twenty-nine words to help you make your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the icons at the top, the leftmost is for Location and takes the user to a “pre-prompt screen”. This is a popular design tactic to explain what the app needs a permission for before prompting for it. This is an attempt at good security UX! Unfortunately, not the best implementation (explained below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle “lock” icon takes users to Scotiabank’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/0,,322,00.html&quot;&gt;Mobile Banking Security and Privacy&lt;/a&gt; site, which is a little wordy for an onboarding flow but actually provides good information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rightmost “question mark” icon takes users to this help page, which also doesn’t belong in an onboarding flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*72vLkc-IgIMl02MxNGgHmA.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*7dRAcaqoBg2bJxfF7_KxoQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*j32rdQPMC_hoKoepXxkTQw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Quick Balance” button creates this alert to tell you more about the feature, but then does nothing on “Continue”, since it requires log in at least once before use. Why is it even here?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In character, the user we are is satisfied with the information provided from the “lock” icon and goes to sign in. The app prompts this security question page, same comments for RBC’s verification question page apply here. Good, opinionated design making for good security UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk-through tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of UX making users make good security decisions, the app scores similarly to RBC. In terms of UX making users aware, the app scores much higher. The Security and Privacy page convey’s necessary information to users although ideally the information would be more concise and more visible, instead of being hidden behind the “lock” icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue with Scotiabank’s app is that the design is a home page with an onboarding flow squeezed in — except the full onboarding experience didn’t fit, so they just hacked off what didn’t fit and threw it out. Scotiabank could give a much better security UX (general UX too) if they properly implemented both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This onboarding flow could remove the location, lock, “Activate Mobile Banking” and “New to Scotiabank” buttons from the home screen, bringing the total number of buttons on the screen to 3. The onboarding flow would then go through each of them one by one, “New to Scotiabank?”, if no “Activate Mobile Banking?”, if already done “Check out how we keep you safe and your information private”, then “Allow us to use your Location to give you travel reminders?”. The benefits of this is better user comprehension and adherence (I wonder how many Scotiabank users have location notifications turned on?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone being used here has a finger print sensor (Apple’s Touch ID no less) so why isn’t it being used?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotiabank tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; Design choices made in the Scotiabank Mobile Banking app seriously limit what can be done for security UX. This is quite frankly a bad app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TD Canada&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting: we are a user looking to do cool things with the TD Canada app, but we also want to make sure it’s safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These screenshots were taken with a iPhone 5 which does not have a finger print sensor, so any additional security features offered by TD’s app regarding the finger print sensor were not captured here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Walk-through&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*y4L2fWseG-NxQPA4h9_Aog.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*O4av7iURlNJjNderFT32LA.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon opening the app, TD Canada first promotes their Quick Access feature. This critique goes for Scotiabank and RBC too, you can’t promote avoiding security as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of an in-flow permission prompt. This prompt is lacking some type of “pre prompt screen” like Scotiabank had and thus as a user we don’t really understand what “Branch Locator” and “TD for Me” do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Hz8GyzJlyU2M0jFE879mdA.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*sn7277ZYK1UG4MVo4orEzg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an excited but concerned user, am I happy to be thrown right in? I quickly scroll down to look for additional security information and find nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the list items ask me to log in — it seems like the TD Canada app also doesn’t like onboarding, but instead of half-implementing it, the app avoids it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*yKR5gdcilmvUUt2eJoXzIg.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*AdzommAO7ed6pXYl97LeXQ.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On sign in, we’re prompted for a security question! The copy here is great! We’re told that this provides additional security AND we have the option to learn more. Great security UX (same problem with verification questions in general though, I’m pretty confident we all can answer this question….).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk-through tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of UX making users make good security decisions, the app scores similarly to RBC and Scotiabank, and for the same reasons as well. In terms of UX making users aware, the app is easily the worst. The TD Canada app makes absolutely no effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Scotiabank’s app, the TD Canada app needs to include an onboarding flow. This point is especially necessary since the app doesn’t have a home screen either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design attempts to satisfy a popular and “good” design practice which is to get users into and using the app straight away. The idea is that users hate manuals and would much rather learn on the fly. I actually agree with this theory, but I think the way TD implemented it here is very bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TD tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; Design choices made in the TD Canada app also seriously limit what can be done for security UX. TD somehow made a worse app than Scotiabank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CIBC Mobile Banking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting: we are a user looking to do cool things with the CIBC Mobile Banking app, but we also want to make sure it’s safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These screenshots were taken with a Nexus 6P which has a finger print sensor, so additional security features offered by CIBC’s app regarding the finger print sensor are expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Walk-through&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*TH3Wed-q3V28bOjAf4uaQA.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*dUUdJ4BFe_JqMMNM5kom1Q.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon open, we’re prompted to open an account and similar to RBC, we’re shown what we can do with the app in panels. Skipping ahead, we’re prompted to sign on with more panels. The panels are decent for shoving information, but nothing here is about security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a hamburger menu icon and shield icon in the corners. In character again, we’ll check those out first. The hamburger menu has nothing of significance, Settings and Legal comes close but contains very little information that contributes to security ux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*2OV3Z7scL1SlmbJ5qUqXig.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shield however is exactly what we’re looking for as a user. This is what all four other apps lacked. As a user we’re “guaranteed” secure banking, how much better can you get? Clicking “Learn more” takes us to this disgusting page explaining the CIBC Online Security Guarantee. This page can use work, but as a user we’re satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signing in doesn’t prompt a security question, but instead prompts a customization of the flow in the future. A picture and nickname provide personal touches, and the inclusion of the fingerprint sign in option is great! Fingerprints are widely accepted as a strong security feature and so using it here will make users feel very safe with keeping this app on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses the phone’s pre-set fingerprints too. This makes this process seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, we’re into the main app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk-through tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of UX making users make good security decisions, the app scores similarly to the others. Although it doesn’t have a security question, it gives the option to sign in with your fingerprint so it balances out. In terms of UX making users aware, the app scores slightly better than Scotiabank, it’s all in the phrasing “guarantee” is a great word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIBC can make their security guarantee more central. Keeping it in one of the panes would be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app can also be more opinionated with their fingerprint feature. Force users to make good security decisions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIBC tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; Overall this app is the best of the bunch. CIBC’s understanding of general UX helps it greatly with it’s security UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A banking app with good security UX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*hdL2RduPmhsyu_twxd1e-g.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my proposal of what a good security UX onboarding would look like. The app starts with a long scrolling page (as opposed to the panels) to get users to check out features before they sign in. This prepares and hypes our users to use the app to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of these would be about the privacy and security policy, and would be in view while users put in their card number and password. This way the user is forced to have this section on the screen for a longer time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security question page is implemented like TD’s app and the security customization page takes inspiration from CIBC’s. Both these pages exemplify opinionated security ux with also explaining what this is for, and also providing more information if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly think this is sufficient to have a good security ux onboaring flow. It doesn’t have to take a lot to give users the tools for them to comprehend and force them to adhere to a standard of security measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Security UX is important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one big misconception in today’s UX world is that users don’t care about security. And for the the past while, that might have been more or less true. Security UX marks a departure from that notion. Users do and will care more than ever that the products they use keep their information safe. By making users aware of how that is happening, and by forcing users to go through additional security measures this can be accomplished. With good security UX, that doesn’t have to be the tedious process that it was in the past. It’s time for design to step up in the security world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Who is Deandre Russell?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Who is Deandre Russell?]]></description><link>https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/who-is-deandre-russell/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/who-is-deandre-russell/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2017 02:15:50 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Who is Deandre Russell?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cloudy Car]]></title><description><![CDATA[Introduction Cloudy Car is an Uber-like application that enables users to become drivers and riders.

&lt;p&gt;Cloudy Car is an Uber-like application that enables users to become drivers and riders. Cloudy Car was built for my Software Development class as a group project. The professor outlined User Stories for us to turn into a functionality spec. The following post will provide a detailed walkthrough and critique of some of the design choices made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walkthrough Part 1: Opening the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*LHrasX7joKQuMZarSWQnLg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon first opening the app, users will be introduced to a signup screen where they will be asked to create a username as well as submit their phone number and email. The user is requested to provide both a phone number and email as a way for drivers/riders to easily contact each other later on in the application. Minimal information is asked for from the user as this in less intrusive to the user and also builds more trust. Arguably, email is not required in this step and can be made “optional” or even removed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The button labeled “LET’S GO” will revert the user to the next step. The phrase “let’s go” is preferred over phrases such as “submit” or “sign up” as it entails a more enthusiastic tone and increases clarity for the user in making the decision to sign up. Perhaps a better option could be “Start Your Cloudy Car Experience”; while this clearly states what the user is doing, it is a very long phrase for a simple screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this process has been completed, the signup screen will not be shown again since one phone does not require multiple accounts. This design for minimal user interaction makes the app more appealing and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once signed up, the user is then guided to the home screen where they are given the option to enter either the driver or the rider side of the application. This screen has only two buttons to signifying a significant action. Both buttons have themed pictures and text copy to make both options more clear to the user. These minimal and clear options help the user make the right decision based on their situation. An improvement to this page could be made by telling the user that this action can be reversed in the future, without this the user may feel more pressured when making their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walkthrough Part 2: Beginning the Request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*d1xWFbYTpc29sTQzfQ8xAg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After picking which side of the application a user would like to utilize, they are refreshed to new screens based off of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rider portion of the application showers users four main tabs: requests pending Driver acceptance, requests accepted by a Driver, accepted requests that the Rider confirmed, and a floating action button to create a new request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By clicking on the floating action button, the user is redirected to a map where they can set pickup destination and a drop off destination. This screen also holds a description box where users can input special messages such as a pickup time. This screen also suggests the user with an estimated price that they can use as a base point in submitting their price point. The option for riders to submit the amount they are willing to pay for a ride does not make sense entirely; however, this spec was a requirement set by the professor. Having this option also allows drivers to price discriminate as riders will enter the maximum they are willing to pay, and drivers can pick the highest paying rider to drive around. If users do not fill out this box, upon clicking the submit button, the recommended price will be auto-filled. This screen again shows minimal design, only featuring UI elements required for a user to make decisions. This screen could be improved by some text copy explaining different options such as taping the map to select a drop-off destination point and that dragging the blue stat point changes the pickup destination. This lack of direction can make users feel stuck or confused as they do not know what to do or have difficulty in submitting destination points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting this information, users are shown a summary of their request and are given an option to edit different elements. This screen could also include more direction as to the various options users have to adjust their pickup and drop-off plan. After submitting the request a second time, the new request will be listed under “pending requests”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walkthrough Part 3: Accepting the Request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*pI30aDBG34yHufTGJRXbWg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After users create a request from the riders side of the application, the driver side of the application comes into play. The driver’s side of the application is set up in a similar manner to the riders side. Users on this side are a list of request forms that they have accepted in the past as well as pending request they can accept at any time they choose. This screen also has search buttons for drivers to look up more pending requests using different filters to eliminate request options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For identification reasons, before a user can enter the driver side, they must first describe their car . If a user tries to get into the driver-side from the hamburger menu in the rider-side, the app brings the user back to the home screen and displays a message to clear any confusion as to the user’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting a request, users are then redirected to a request details screen where they can review and accept the request. A link to the rider’s profile details is also present on this display. Accepting the request will add the request to the “accepted requests” list in the driver-side main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walkthrough Part 4: Confirming the Request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*JW4x3SMi8rWek6PfjPKcrw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For riders, accepted requests will now show up under the “Accepted” subheading on the main rider-side screen. Riders can navigate through the details page by clicking the request; this will show pickup and destination locations and the list of drivers who accepted the request. This gives riders an opportunity to view the different drivers’ profiles, to provide them with a larger sense of security. Once the riders confirm a driver, the driver is notified, and the request will be shown under the “Confirmed” subheading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walkthrough Part 5: Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden gestures such as tapping the map to set destination point or swipe to delete functionality on requests can be handled in many ways, some of which are outlined in an article by Nick Babich and can be read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxplanet.org/how-to-communicate-hidden-gestures-in-mobile-app-e55397f4006b#.3mh7g8bka&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was much debate over the hamburger menu is kept in a consistent place for users to view their profile. Quick links are also strategically placed on both the rider and driver sides of the application to increase usability. A fix for this function would be adding a setting option in this menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colour scheme was chosen in accordance with the logo and different shades of grey to make the app easy to see and consistent throughout. Colour can be a good way to call for users attention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/file/CMWDB91uJl7BNB8G1JTUaw6r/Cloudy-Car&quot;&gt;mockups&lt;/a&gt; for the app can be seen on figma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This app was designed with the given User Stories as requirements. This allowed the design of the app to be our own — thus allowing me to use design tactics learned from reading Medium articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: App mockups were made with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mengto/figma-vs-sketch-c01e5e74eddd#.v7j33vcdl&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, the online version of Sketch, and can be viewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/file/CMWDB91uJl7BNB8G1JTUaw6r/Cloudy-Car&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the mockups differ slightly from the actual screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*tp1FxVDz7w7ouPS2kxly0Q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;President’s Address at Business Celebration Night 2013 — I presented my work to the school’s business community!&quot;&gt;
President’s Address at Business Celebration Night 2013 — I presented my work to the school’s business community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then I resented creativity. I was about science and math and my future was in engineering, what did I need art for? But really the creativity was always there. In high school, I was a super volunteer involved in many clubs and associations. My journey starts here, not with a display of creativity, but with a realization of what was needed. As a senior at Campbell Collegiate, I was eager to make change and establish my legacy. As the 2nd President of Campbell’s shiny new Business Club, I wanted to do so by create connections between the students and business folk from around Saskatchewan. However, halfway through the year I realized that only in our second year, such a lofty goal was unattainable. Lasting connections need to be made organically and over time. This is how I learned to look at the real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*iBWOyqeTKkoI3NvgvmZYNA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The entrance of FourthDimensionInc. where I first learned to be a developer&quot;&gt;
The entrance of FourthDimensionInc. where I first learned to be a developer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my first year at University, I slowly became more interested in software. The next summer I got a job at Fourth Dimension, my cousin’s Digital Marketing Agency, to build an Ionic web app and teach me what it means to be a developer. Fourth Dimension has a UI Developer and upon meeting him I was intrigued that he was a specialist — he only knew how to style webpages. It was so strange to me that he earned a living knowing only one thing, he didn’t understand any of the JavaScript I had written. I remember asking my cousin, who told me that specialists have a premium, being able to do everything well may not be as valuable as being able to do one thing the best. He explained to me that UI Design can be a lot of work, and for a Digital Marketing Agency it is very important to have someone who is the best. There is a premium for design, and clients pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since working at Forth Dimension, I learned a lot about software applications and finally began to understand why design is so important. But not the same design as the UI Developer, a new definition that combines solving the real problem and making it look and feel good for the user. Good design isn’t just art, like I thought back in high school, apps with design create great experiences for their users and creates value because in order for the application to be valuable, it needs to be designed for it’s users. Users will love an application if it’s usable, works and looks well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me by surprise when design ended up being the thing I became passionate about considering I resented creativity just a few years ago. Of course the definition of design changed a little, but I really really want to create valuable experiences for the people of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of my 2017 Iceland trip, how I got there and what I learned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part 1: HOW I GOT THERE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great opportunities are great. No question about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is why don’t people ever talk about the work that has to be done to get those great opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2017 the faculty of engineering, as well as the faculties of science and business, decided they wanted a first hand look at a 3 week, multidisciplinary entrepreneurship course in Reykjavik. They hoped the students and staff sent would be able to implement and help run a similar course back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They picked me. All-expenses-paid. Three weeks in Iceland. Entre bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming off two degrees in Computer Engineering and UI Design, I’m ready to get a job where I can work on useful products in a lean product development cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Objective &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to work for a Product Agency, an agency that’s contracted out to build products for their clients. These agencies work on the entire product development cycle, from UX research to possibly marketing. As a do-it-all, I’m really attracted to working and learning in this environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strategy follows this rough process: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network.&lt;/strong&gt; Which product agencies can I be easily connected with? These are the agencies I’ll have the best chance at engaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research.&lt;/strong&gt; What are the brands of these companies? By knowing their inner motivation and purpose, I can learn what they look for in prospective hires. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand.&lt;/strong&gt; How can I tailor my own brand to what they’re looking for? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design.&lt;/strong&gt; Design up my website/portfolio/resume/etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build.&lt;/strong&gt; Build out my website/portfolio/resume/etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact.&lt;/strong&gt; Use my network to get in touch with product agencies. Our industry is very karma based, everyone will be willing to help out if you ask. Just remember to pay it forward! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*W_8nQk2LRcepZi_E&quot; alt=&quot;Let’s do great things ;)&quot;&gt;
Let’s do great things ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Network &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://robynlarsen.ca/&quot;&gt;Robyn Larsen&lt;/a&gt; said she’d help connect me with companies she knows in Toronto. I was planning on asking multiple people, but her response listed enough companies for research’s sake. They were: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twg.io/&quot;&gt;TWG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rangle.io/&quot;&gt;Rangle.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symbilitysolutions.com/symbility-intersect/&quot;&gt;Symbility Intersect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metalab.co/&quot;&gt;Metalab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get to the connect step, I’ll ask more friends to connect me with companies they know. But for now, let’s look up these companies! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front page of all four sites are focused on converting potential clients. There isn’t a lot of information on their company culture, which is what I need to break down their brand filter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brand filter is used for marketing to help a organize and strategize a brand. It covers the brand’s motivation, purpose, values, persona and behaviour (in that order), each using the previous to determine the next. Building marketing campaigns this way help build/maintain the brand’s brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TWG’s brand is all about how software experiences can change the world. Rangle is about curiosity and passion&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Finally figuring out what rem spacing is]]></title><description><![CDATA[Finally figuring out what rem spacing is I just I stalled Firefox and was incredibly unhappy with how my site looked on the browser.

&lt;p&gt;I just I stalled Firefox and was incredibly unhappy with how my site looked on the browser. Turns out it was `rem`.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`rem` is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned about Design Systems recently and for my new app I wanted to start exploring them by using StorybookJs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever been a designer and a developer and wanted to stop making components twice, once in your design tool, then again in code? This is what motivated me to try StorybookJs, although I won’t really be using it to solve that problem, yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, StorybookJs also helps me organize my components, test them later on, and, best of all, develop them in an abstracted way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began by reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/nulogy/storybook-driven-development-a3c517276c07&quot;&gt;Storybook Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/2e96c7be4493&quot;&gt;Ned Schwartz,&lt;/a&gt; it starts off with a much better explaination of why we should use Storybook Driven Development (SDD) than I’ve given here. I highly recommend reading it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading that I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://storybook.js.org/&quot;&gt;storybook.js.org&lt;/a&gt; to set up StorybookJs for my Angular project. All was good until I did the first step. Turns out Storybook for Angular is having issues right now and I wasted a couple hours trying to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days later I came back to finish adding StorybookJs to my project by updating my project to Ionic v4 and Angular 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with Storybook, this gif (from the tutorial linked above) shows how I’m going to start building and styling components. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see that in action with …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thanks goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/1aeed18fd27d&quot;&gt;Varun Vachhar&lt;/a&gt; for showing me Storybook and encouraging me always 😃&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ShoutBox]]></title><description><![CDATA[Introduction This project was completed in the Summer of 2015, I want to go back to comment on it.  Shoutbox is a Chrome Extension that…]]></description><link>https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/drafts/draft_ShoutBox-f33db2b88382.md/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.arjunkalburgi.com/writing/drafts/draft_ShoutBox-f33db2b88382.md/</guid><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was completed in the Summer of 2015, I want to go back to comment on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoutbox is a Chrome Extension that allows you to tweet from Chrome’s address bar. The &lt;strong&gt;product&lt;/strong&gt; has an associate &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoutboxextension.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is a redesign of an even older project. The design is taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5up.net&quot;&gt;html5up.net&lt;/a&gt; and should thus have decent design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walkthrough&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6CT8bb4QpH3k8GrmDX7BSQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ShoutBox website begins with a beautiful banner with nice colours and animation. The text copy reminds users what they are getting into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*7S71KjBYabKKCmmfiNXsPQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section explains what is needed from the user. Content here is acceptable, but the text is small in comparison to how large the whitespace is, the action button draws no attention and the image doesn’t convey any meaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closer at the image, it actually does convey clarity to the user, but it is too chaotic and the message is unclear. If the background was blurred out and sunken slightly from the browser window, it might be better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Jyyw43Z8wm6lLS-ADylPHQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These next sections are unimportant, but the design doesn’t do anything to convey that. Same issues with the pictures and the small text, but not with the buttons/links. Since these links are not an important action, this design is okay here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of the header to remind users where they are is nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*FsIaH0oQPIpF-YexdiWVAA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something tells me there’s a smarter way to ask for donations. Starting a sentence with “If you would…” seems too passive. The donate button itself is also very passive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*DkZ32-3n_qeHhYqL82s9Ww.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*giMBZBy7NDmLnWMEexS2yg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending off with contact info and credits is nice, but signifies the weirdest part of the website — that the site is a combination of a main action and additional information in the style of a homepage. If I re-did the ShoutBox website, I would make it a proper homescreen, with a link to the Chrome extension and a more pronounced donate button.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
