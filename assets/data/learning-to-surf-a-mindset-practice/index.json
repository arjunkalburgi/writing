It was awesome.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*uvXFHkNWEbWeJ5Mp\"></p>\n<p>I signed up for the 8am beginners class and made my way to the beach. What followed was a phenomenal practice in Growth Mindset.</p>\n<p>There were 2 other girls that took the beginner class with me. They were able to to stand on the board after a couple of tries (we were each paired with an instructor that would help push the board and all we were practicing was being able to stand up and get balanced).</p>\n<p>But I couldn’t stand on the board until 10 minutes left in the 2 hour class.</p>\n<p>I fell so many times.</p>\n<p>After every fall I’d ask my instructor what did I do wrong? He would tell me, and I would try again.</p>\n<p>At one point he’s said “bro one more and we’ll take a break”, to which I said “fuck breaks! I’m getting this shit.”</p>\n<p>In 2 hours, the other two girls were able to stand like 70 times. I was only able to stand 4 times.</p>\n<p>But it ended in the best way, my instructor looks at his watch and told me it’s going to be the last one.</p>\n<p>I get on the board.</p>\n<p>I stand.</p>\n<p>I balance.</p>\n<p>And I rode the wave all the way to the shore.</p>\n<p>It was awesome.</p>\n<p>Even though I kept failing, it wasn’t frustrating at all. I kept thinking about Mindset and what it means to fail. I put so much effort into concentrating and observing what I was doing so when my instructor told me what I was doing wrong I knew exactly what he was talking about. It was so awesome to force myself to learn.</p>\n<p>And most importantly, I had so much fun. 100% would do it all over again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pBG7K09M2bK_3ZtC\"></p>\n<p>Also interesting, everyone at the beach (in Chennai, India) called each other “bro” 😂 I guess surfing culture is universal?</p>\n","date":"March 16, 2019","timeToRead":1,"cover":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pBG7K09M2bK_3ZtC","description":"Recently I went surfing for the first time ever.
