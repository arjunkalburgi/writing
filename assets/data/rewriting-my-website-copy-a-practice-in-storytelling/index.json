I had been thinking about it for well over a year but haven‚Äôt been quite sure on what or how I needed to go about it. </p>\n<p>For nearly two years the website copy struck a dreamer tone, gushing about creating magic and a cheesy line about making users smile. The site also strongly featured my fascination with being a unicorn (developer-designer hybrid) which now, a few years later, means nothing more to me than some skills I have. </p>\n<p>Clearly this website didn‚Äôt reflect me anymore. And when I wrote a peppy introduction for a new Slack team I joined, I somehow knew that my site needed more of that tone - more me. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-writing-process\"><a href=\"#the-writing-process\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The writing process</h2>\n<p>So I went about writing this new copy using the same storytelling process my cousin taught me in this vlog I made. </p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1.

Start upbeat and bold, so the audience is like wow this guy. \n2. But then get thoughtful and a little deep (not too deep) \n3. Coast on that balance for a bit \n4. Then tightly wrap it up with some joy</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then the plot points to go with the emotional journey </p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. Bold introduction \n2. Core drive \n3. Things I&#39;ve done \n4. Continuing exploring</code></pre></div>\n<p>And finally writing it.
