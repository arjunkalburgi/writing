It’s just a simple boilerplate Node.js app designed to be as versatile as possible.</p>\n<p>I cleaned out most of the app and built my own view using <a href=\"http://html5up.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HTML5UP</a>’s <a href=\"https://html5up.net/forty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Forty</a> template that would become the view of our app.</p>\n<h4 id=\"implementing-the-api\"><a href=\"#implementing-the-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Implementing the API</h4>\n<p>Next I used <code class=\"language-text\">axios</code> to call the API my group-mates prepared for the front-end and created a new router for the application to take in a userId from the URL.</p>\n<p>Inputting the userId from the URL just made sense for this project since CBC Radio Canada doesn’t actually have accounts, so user data is actually stored through browser cache. Using a router was better than creating a “log in” page since the real CBC Radio Canada wouldn’t have a log in anyway.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fixing-the-design\"><a href=\"#fixing-the-design\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Fixing the Design</h4>\n<p>HTML5UP’s Forty is a great template, but it didn’t follow Radio Canada’s mandatory accessibility guidelines. I put a bit of my CSS and design skills to work fixing these issues.</p>\n<p>First I fixed the text size, good accessibility should have text size above 12px.</p>\n<p>Then I fixed the colour contrast of the white text on the image content tiles by changing the colours to values that have acceptable contrast.</p>\n<p>I also made sure that text was not <code class=\"language-text\">uppercase</code> . Uppercase text is harder to read and screen readers will read this text as shouting. A poor experience.</p>\n<p>Lastly I added an animation to only show descriptions on hover, this was so that you could better see the images in the background. Accessibility guidelines state that all hidden text should still be readable by screen readers, so I found a way to create the animation without using <code class=\"language-text\">display: none</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/CBCRCHackathon2018/engaging-imagery-website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">View all code on Github</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"results\"><a href=\"#results\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Results</h3>\n<p>In the end we did what we wanted, creating an entirely new experience for Radio Canada viewers with personalized content. We’re really proud of our work, this was a great project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tov7eVsRZTlR6R8tfdVydA.jpeg\" alt=\"(Note text here is uppercase because it is an old version)\">\n(Note text here is uppercase because it is an old version)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qi4oy5cjqtw?t=5003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">See us present live!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tell me how it is via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/askalburgi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/askalburgi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</a>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RLTVE0wgjEfhsrXK8cZ4hw.png\"></p>\n<h5 id=\"bonus\"><a href=\"#bonus\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bonus,</h5>\n<p>such a bad screen-grab from the President of CBC Radio Canada 😂\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*v4EpnYvimzZ21z4OFQoPKg.png\" alt=\"such a bad screen-grab from the President of CBC Radio Canada 😂\"></p>\n","date":"February 4, 2019","timeToRead":2,"description":"This weekend I teamed up with my friends Abid and Meg to participate in CBC Radio-Canada’s hackathon all about personalization.","cover":""}},"context":{}}
