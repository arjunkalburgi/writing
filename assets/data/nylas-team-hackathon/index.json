Between Dashboard and Components we managed to ship a ridiculous amount of new features and I was particularly impressed with the amount of things I was able to do.</p>\n<p>Most of them focus on style and experience improvements ranging from tweaks to layouts. I think reflecting on what I chose to work on might be interesting so let's go!</p>\n<h4 id=\"datatable-click-ux-failed\"><a href=\"#datatable-click-ux-failed\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>DataTable click UX (failed)</h4>\n<p>Our current data table's click action is not accessible to keyboard users via tabbing. Unfortunately I couldn't launch this because the buttons I added would go off screen due to a responsiveness problem that has too much red tape to solve.</p>\n<h4 id=\"page-title-consistency\"><a href=\"#page-title-consistency\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Page title consistency</h4>\n<p>This is a small one, I noticed that some pages in the dashboard did not have the correct title in the tab. I quickly corrected these bugs with one consistent sweep through all of our pages.</p>\n<h4 id=\"state-indicator-shapes\"><a href=\"#state-indicator-shapes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>State Indicator Shapes</h4>\n<p>For colorblind users, distinguishing by colour is not sufficient. I upgraded our status indicators to be shapes as well as colours; green circle, blue square, and red triangle.</p>\n<h4 id=\"amplitude-error-fix\"><a href=\"#amplitude-error-fix\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Amplitude Error Fix</h4>\n<p>My coworker and I were coming across the same failing tests so we paired to resolve them. Turns out it was just a missed catch block,</p>\n<h4 id=\"mobile-datatable\"><a href=\"#mobile-datatable\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Mobile DataTable</h4>\n<p>The main function of the Dashboard is for users to check the status of their accounts and the mobile experience for this was essentially unusable. I upgraded the design to a simple list style with a much improved text hierarchy which I hope will increase brand trust from our users.</p>\n<h4 id=\"nav-improvements\"><a href=\"#nav-improvements\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Nav Improvements</h4>\n<p>The main sidebar navigation of the Dashboard needed an accessibility update and our design team had a number of tweaks for it in mind as well. In 5 separate PRs I worked on updating different parts of the Nav, including making it collapsible, with varying degrees of pairing with my coworkers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"breadcrumbs\"><a href=\"#breadcrumbs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>To make the Dashboard’s page structure easier to understand, the design team made mockups for breadcrumbs. After implementing them I’ve been so impressed with the increased functionality for mobile users!</p>\n<h4 id=\"component-settings-elements\"><a href=\"#component-settings-elements\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Component Settings Elements</h4>\n<p>Last month we had to move some pretty UI elements into tech debt to make our launch deadline. I built and brought them to life - elevating the entire page’s level of sophistication. </p>\n<h4 id=\"blogpost\"><a href=\"#blogpost\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Blogpost</h4>\n<p>Last but not least, I led the team in co-writing a little blog post featuring some of the big ticket items we launched over the two week hackathon. My hope is to get that blog released publicly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It was a productive two weeks for sure. I think it’s really awesome to see accessibility be such a common motivation for many of these features. Other trends like the focus on UI and lack of deviation from the Dashboard are less surprising. </p>\n<p>Overall I feel very good about the last two weeks! I’ll definitely be romanticizing them in my head every now and then.</p>\n","date":"April 21, 2021","timeToRead":2,"cover":null,"description":"Recently my team at Nylas wrapped up a 2 week hackathon and I was particularly impressed with the amount of things I was able to do."}},"context":{}}
