Here I did the same thing but with the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP, GreenSock)</a>.</p>\n<p>Although I could have done the animation entirely in CSS, the purpose of this experiment was to see how I could animate using the multiple SVGâ€™s I had created previously.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AtJwk7_cpzGFJI6nZkMsjg.png\"></p>\n<p>This is the same screenshot of my Figma design asset from before. There are 4 paths here that I want to animate to each other with an easing between them.</p>\n<p>With SVGâ€™s <code class=\"language-text\">animate</code> the preferred effect was not achieved, though mostly the basic motion was.</p>\n<p>At first I had a lot of trouble trying to adapt my SVGâ€™s because GSAP isnâ€™t perfectly meant to be used to manipulate the <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> path of SVG elements. However, I eventually figured out how to do it after a bunch of Google searches.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">tl<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">to</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>dotA<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>   \n      <span class=\"token number\">0.8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>  \n      attr<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>  \n        d<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"M59.0596 ... 959Z\"</span>  \n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>   \n      ease<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Power1<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>easeInOut<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>  \n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The trick just happened to be to wrap the <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> modification in the <code class=\"language-text\">attr</code> block. This successfully applied the <code class=\"language-text\">dotA</code> path element in the SVG with the new <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> path.</p>\n<p>I went on to apply this same animation to the other 4 path elements.</p>\n<p>The final result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GOG3jx9dVNpwbrq4TjvZAA.gif\"></p>\n<p>I have a theory as to why there is that strange sharpness of the dots during the animation, but thatâ€™s for another blog!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cuvajqmhcC8_croNpCLZFg.png\"></p>\n<p>Thank you!
