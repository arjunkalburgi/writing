From the professionals that walk with their heels and nice coats to the students and other people that wander the city, everyone here has a purpose and they dress for it. It looks so good.</p>\n<p>The vibe left a major impression on me three and a half years ago.

I cared about my image thanks to Toronto.</p>\n<p>Today I find myself in a similar situation.
