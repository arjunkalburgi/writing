This is what motivated me to try StorybookJs, although I wonâ€™t really be using it to solve that problem, yet.Â </p>\n<p>Instead, StorybookJs also helps me organize my components, test them later on, and, best of all, develop them in an abstracted way.Â </p>\n<p>I began by reading <a href=\"https://medium.com/nulogy/storybook-driven-development-a3c517276c07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Storybook Driven Development</a> by <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/2e96c7be4493\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ned Schwartz,</a> it starts off with a much better explaination of why we should use Storybook Driven Development (SDD) than Iâ€™ve given here.
