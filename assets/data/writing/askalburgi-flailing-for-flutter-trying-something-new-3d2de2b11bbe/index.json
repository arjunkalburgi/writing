For a front-end developer, this was really helpful.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately it also took forever, thanks to XCode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MuJ50QXKz3DI7FsuyFtWxQ.png\"></p>\n<p>After forever, weâ€™re now ready to go! (Iâ€™m choosing to work in VS Code)</p>\n<h3 id=\"andriod-emulator-and-ios-simulator\"><a href=\"#andriod-emulator-and-ios-simulator\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Andriod Emulator and iOS Simulator</h3>\n<p>Before I could get to coding I had to set up the Android and iOS devices on my machine. Fortunately I had ones set up for previous projects, I just needed to launch them like so:</p>\n<p>$ flutter emulators<br>\n$ flutter emulators --launch Pixel_2_XL_API_28<br>\n$ flutter emulators --launch iOS Simulator<br>\n$ flutter run -d all</p>\n<p>This runs the starter app on both!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NriZDJE1wntOJXn0xB8j-w.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"starter-app\"><a href=\"#starter-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Starter App</h3>\n<p>Now to start messing around! Iâ€™m using <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this tutorial</a> provided from the Flutter team as a start.</p>\n<p>With the tutorial, I created a list (useful) and started learning about Flutterâ€™s state (not really though).</p>\n<p>I continued on to <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/#0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">part 2</a>, which had me add interactive icons to list items to save them, navigate to a page to view saved list items, and begin theming the app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theming\"><a href=\"#theming\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Theming</h3>\n<p>Theming is one of the big reasons I wanted to try Flutter and itâ€™s got a theming framework I wanted to try.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SGb5vC4lmEvxolDwI2Lm5g.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*1IDC32PB1JC_3w4vOUC7lQ.png\" alt=\"Times andÂ Blue\">\nTimes andÂ Blue</p>\n<p>First try at theming was promising, even just with changing the font and the primary colour. I feel like itâ€™s generally stuck to the typical Material Design layout with the AppBar shadow and the darker background colour. Fortunately, I was quickly able to fix those, but Iâ€™m not certain I can make Flutter bend to <strong>all</strong> my UI wishes, would need more exploration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*740y6H3WRm8JEZPbSM8tcQ.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"graphs\"><a href=\"#graphs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Graphs</h3>\n<p>Equally important as theming is the ability to have good graphs. For this Iâ€™m looking at <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/charts_flutter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">charts_flutter</a> recommended by the quick tutorial <a href=\"https://medium.com/flutter-io/beautiful-animated-charts-for-flutter-164940780b8c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">blog post here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k3PI_0RZuvvD9CQRGYHfTQ.png\"></p>\n<p>The tutorial is to get a bar chart up but I need a line chart with specific properties, which proved to be much more difficult thanks to some of the code from the bar chart tutorial messing me up. I had to redo the bar chart demo a couple of times and add in <a href=\"https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/time_series_charts/simple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this Line Chart demo</a> carefully.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EJS1ev59fgo2DpKWB6vnTg.png\"></p>\n<p>I donâ€™t care for my chart being interactive, so I dropped that extra fluff from the tutorial. What I need is to make the graph moveable and zoomable along the yaxis, which I donâ€™t think <em>flutter_charts</em> will be able to do.</p>\n<p>But I tried anyway, starting with a bunch of different tutorials from <a href=\"https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/gallery.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. I actually ran into a lot of errors while trying to set all these up and while some of them were clearly due to my unfamiliarity with Flutter, some of them were very: ðŸ¤¨. Thatâ€™s a drawback.</p>\n<p>I ended up finding the <a href=\"https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/axes/numeric_initial_viewport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Numeric Initial Viewport Axes Example</a> which did the scrolling y-axis for me and just needed to combine it with the <a href=\"https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/behaviors/selection_callback_example.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Selection Callback Interactions Example</a> (which features a TimeSeriesChart, which I need). This actually proved to be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>In the end I wasnâ€™t able to get it to work seemingly due to a <a href=\"https://github.com/google/charts/issues/134\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">bug that hasnâ€™t been fixed</a>. This is how it wouldâ€™ve worked though, by setting up a viewport and allowing PanAndZoomBehavior.:</p>\n<p>new charts.TimeSeriesChart(<br>\nwidget.seriesList,<br>\nanimate: widget.animate,<br>\ndomainAxis: new charts.DateTimeAxisSpec(<br>\nviewport: new charts.DateTimeExtents(<br>\nstart: new DateTime(2017, 10, 3),<br>\nend: new DateTime(2017, 10, 10))),<br>\nbehaviors: [new charts.PanAndZoomBehavior()],<br>\nselectionModels: [new charts.SelectionModelConfig(<br>\ntype: charts.SelectionModelType.info,<br>\nchangedListener: _onSelectionChanged,<br>\n)],<br>\n)</p>\n<p>Turns out Flutter isnâ€™t capable of the graphing I needÂ :(</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In conclusion, Flutter seems like a pretty cool way to make apps but unfortunately itâ€™s chart library isnâ€™t functional and customizable enough.</p>\n<p>Looks like Iâ€™m sticking to Ionic Angular with plot.lyÂ :)</p>\n<h4 id=\"follow-me\"><a href=\"#follow-me\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Follow me</h4>\n<p>For more of my coding, designing, and problem solving journey, follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/askalburgi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Medium</a>.
