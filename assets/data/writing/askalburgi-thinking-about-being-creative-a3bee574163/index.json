What they mean is, “I’m not artsy”.</p>\n<p>There are so many ways to be creative and we’re all creative in so many ways. Any type of organizing or critical thinking is in fact creativity. It took me a long time to learn this and I think I’m still understanding it.</p>\n<p>I kept the word <em>creative</em> in the captions of the pictures because I wanted to make one point not two.
