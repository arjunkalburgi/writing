But it’s a step :) I just wanted to share this little proud moment of realization.</p>\n<p>Also, more pictures:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mx19kFTWUbwV8KBpMW4eEw.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lVJ5o6GwyjGTDNcNeANnJA.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3_pVQ9n_GCOr21L_hhVuJQ.png\"></p>\n","date":"December 14, 2017","timeToRead":1,"description":"I posted to Instagram a while back,","image":""}},"context":{}}
