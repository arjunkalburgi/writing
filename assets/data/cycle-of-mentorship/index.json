I don’t even want to imagine it.</p>\n<p>Throughout high school I was always involved in clubs, and after stepping away from it in first year, maybe I wanted to get back?</p>\n<p>I was transitioning between friend groups at the time. Maybe I felt like I would find good friends through CompE Club?</p>\n<p>Or maybe I knew, that the 5th year students had something to teach me.</p>\n<p>They’re the people that helped me set up my <a href=\"http://www.arjunkalburgi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">website</a> and launch my first <a href=\"https://connectfour275.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">project</a> back in 2014. And even in 2017 they’re the people that teach me <a href=\"https://github.com/askalburgi/tick-tack-toe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ReactJS</a>, give me advice and tell me stories. 3 years later I still maintain connections with them.</p>\n<p>I’m thinking about this now, because now I’m the 5th year student. It’s weird to think that I can be that 5th year presence while still being me. I’m forever a student in my mind.</p>\n<p>This weekend I spoke at CompE orientation, to all the new second year CompE’s. I told them a lot of the things and stories that my mentors told me, and more.</p>\n<p>My presentation at CompE Orientation</p>\n<p>I’ve already got tons of emails from these students asking for advice on how to start and where to look and what to do.</p>\n<p>So far the questions have been pretty easy.</p>\n<p>BUT IT’S JUST ME</p>\n<p>I’m that same kid from 2014, I’m not sure I could answer the same questions I asked back then. But I am sure that I’ll do my best.</p>\n<p>Being on the other side, being a mentor, is a new challenge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*53lPEky3ithWRORA9eP8Ug.png\" alt=\"Let’s see. Lol.\">\nLet’s see. Lol.<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k3x4eNfGaG54H9skwyKeSA.png\"></p>\n","date":"September 19, 2017","timeToRead":1,"description":"Where would you be without mentors?
