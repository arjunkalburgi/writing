Now that I moved my job search to Toronto, I decided to go out of my comfort zone and reach out to him about helping me on my animation. His response was more than I could’ve asked for!</p>\n<p>He ended up making a CodePen that forked mine, showing me that GSAP can re-run the animation after completion:</p>\n<p>I made some tweaks to it and ended up with the following, which is now applied to my website! It’s a much more natural movement for the leaves! Thanks Varun!</p>\n<p>In that same thread, Varun also talked about using <a href=\"https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">p5 to animate noise</a>, something I’ve never even heard of. I asked him to meet for coffee so I could learn more and he told me all kinds of background information about animation frameworks that I never knew! I think it’ll really help me learn animations moving forward because up till now it’s really been throwing darts in the dark.</p>\n<p>So I guess what I learned is that the process of randomly tweeting at people for code mentorship is pretty awesome! I’m definitely going to do it more.</p>\n","date":"April 21, 2019","timeToRead":1,"cover":null,"description":"Recently I sent a tweet to a stranger that I follow on Twitter asking for his help.
