They’re a full send on getting you out of your comfort zone. They’re always described as “finding yourself” or “discovery” because you’re putting yourself in an uncomfort zone and you force yourself to grow because of it.</p>\n<p>My solo trip was not scary. It wasn’t an uncomfort zone. It wasn’t even on the edge of my comfort zone, it was smack dab in the middle.</p>\n<p>I’m too extroverted.</p>\n<p>When I got there I immediately started meeting people by playing basketball in the park, talking to people at malls and coffee shops and adding everyone I met on Instagram.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heV5yUua1VQhAY42yVXKV8_q9qNzwAI0GQ/preview\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heV5yUua1VQhAY42yVXKV8_q9qNzwAI0GQ/preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Arjun goes to play basketball in the park</strong></a><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heV5yUua1VQhAY42yVXKV8_q9qNzwAI0GQ/preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p>This realization really clicked for me when I did open mic stand up, (almost) impromptu, 4 days into my trip.
