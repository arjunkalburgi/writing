Iâ€™ve taken 3 weeks off before, I went to India for that long just 5 months agoâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut the context around that trip and my most recent one were very different. Because now I have a job where I work until I burn outâ€Šâ€”â€ŠIâ€™m learning how to not do that.

This recent trip started in New York with a half-week with my cousins, where we walked all day and everywhere.

Then continued for a week with some more family, where we were such a big group we could only manage to visit one or two tourist attractions per day.

The trip continued further to LA, where even more family met up to take a week-long cruise down Mexicoâ€™s Pasific coast.

And because it was cheaper to fly out of LA a few days after the cruise docked, I stayed with my uncle in LA for 2 days.

So effectively I had a vacation (2 days in LA) for the vacation (cruise) for the vacation (touring NY). I was so fresh and high spirited upon coming back from this trip. I was excited about coming in to work this week, until I sat down to actually workâ€¦

Groggy, lethargic, and unfocused. I spent the week diving into my backlog looking for work that I would be able to concentrate on and Iâ€™m actually still finding it so difficult to work.

But Iâ€™m taking it easy, working myself back into my routine, because Iâ€™m learning that time is fickle, and things take time. ðŸ˜ƒ
