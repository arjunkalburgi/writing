This should be easy, but the documentation for it is a little lacking. Iâ€™ve [asked](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/pull/17944#issuecomment-522067671) them to update it but just in case they donâ€™t Iâ€™m writing this for your sanity.

### Issue

Originally my issue was that the modal was activating too early, before the button-press to activate the modal. When I would navigate to the page that the modal should be accessed on, it would show the modal as a full page instead of the page Iâ€™ve navigated to.

This solution will also help solve the `ERROR ERROR: "Uncaught (in promise): overlay does not exist"` when trying to dismiss the modal. Another issue that I saw people having when trying to find a solution.

### Solution

#### Creating a ModalÂ Page

Very basic, just run `ionic g page modal` using Ionic CLI just like you would for any other new page.

#### Fixing theÂ Routing

Since modal pages arenâ€™t part of your app navigation, you must remove the automatic entry for this page from your `app-routing-module.ts` file.

const routes: Routes = \[

     { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },  
     ...  
     {Ìµ ÌµpÌµaÌµtÌµhÌµ:Ìµ Ìµ'ÌµmÌµoÌµdÌµaÌµlÌµ'Ìµ,Ìµ Ìµ  
       lÌµoÌµaÌµdÌµCÌµhÌµiÌµlÌµdÌµrÌµeÌµnÌµ:Ìµ Ìµ'Ìµ.Ìµ/ÌµmÌµoÌµdÌµaÌµlÌµ/ÌµmÌµoÌµdÌµaÌµlÌµ.ÌµmÌµoÌµdÌµuÌµlÌµeÌµ#ÌµMÌµoÌµdÌµaÌµlÌµPÌµaÌµgÌµeÌµMÌµoÌµdÌµuÌµlÌµeÌµ'Ìµ Ìµ}Ìµ

\];

#### Fix the Modalâ€™sÂ Module

This part is neccessary to solve the issue.

@NgModule({  
     declarations: \[ **ModalPage** \],  
     imports: \[ ... \],  
     entryComponents: \[ **ModalPage** \],  
     exports: \[ **ModalPage \]  
**})  
export class ModalPageModule {}

The documentation does not show to include the page in `entryComponents` or `exports`.

#### Declare the Modal forÂ Use

Now that the modalâ€™s module is ready, import it into the page you want to use it in.

@NgModule({  
     declarations: \[ HomePage, **ModalPage** \],  
     imports: \[ ... \],  
     entryComponents: \[ **ModalPage** \],})  
export class HomePageModule {}

The documentation does not show either of these! This is a big part of how the issue happens. Including the `ModalPage` in `imports` is what creates the problem (and is what I thought to do).

#### Create theÂ Modal

The following is exactly how the documentation explains, Iâ€™m just including it here for completionâ€™s sake.

import { ModalController } from '@ionic/angular';

export class **HomePage** {

  constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) { }

  async openModal() {  
    const loadAmount = await _this_.modalCtrl.create({  
      component: **ModalPage**  
    });  
    await loadAmount.present();  
  }

}

#### Dismiss theÂ Modal

import { ModalController } from '@ionic/angular';

export class **ModalPage** {

  constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) { }

  async close() {  
    await _this_.modalCtrl.dismiss();  
  }

}

### Conclusion

Just like that, everything should be working perfectly. I was so relieved when I implemented these steps. Thank you to [Christian Francia](https://medium.com/u/706b6e4cb229) for providing this solution in a [Github issue](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/17939#issuecomment-479550015), hopefully this blog post will have a little better SEO and will be easier to find ğŸ˜ƒ
