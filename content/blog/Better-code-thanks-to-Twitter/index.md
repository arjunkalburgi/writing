> Recently I sent a tweet to a stranger that I follow on Twitter asking for his help. The result? The coding culture on the Internet is great.

I’ve been really annoyed with the _leaves animation_ on my portfolio.

Though unnoticeable in use on my website, I hated how the leaves would bounce back and forth between two points but I didn’t really know how I could fix it (I’m new to animations).

I’ve been following [Varun Vachhar](https://medium.com/u/1aeed18fd27d) on Twitter for some time and see his animation work all the time. Now that I moved my job search to Toronto, I decided to go out of my comfort zone and reach out to him about helping me on my animation. His response was more than I could’ve asked for!

Click the Tweet to see the thread!

He ended up making a CodePen that forked mine, showing me that GSAP can re-run the animation after completion:

I made some tweaks to it and ended up with the following, which is now applied to my website! It’s a much more natural movement for the leaves! Thanks Varun!

In that same thread, Varun also talked about using [p5 to animate noise](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise), something I’ve never even heard of. I asked him to meet for coffee so I could learn more and he told me all kinds of background information about animation frameworks that I never knew! I think it’ll really help me learn animations moving forward because up till now it’s really been throwing darts in the dark.

So I guess what I learned is that the process of randomly tweeting at people for code mentorship is pretty awesome! I’m definitely going to do it more.
