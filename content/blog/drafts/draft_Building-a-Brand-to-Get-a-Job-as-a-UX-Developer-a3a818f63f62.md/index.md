> Coming off two degrees in Computer Engineering and UI Design, I’m ready to get a job where I can work on useful products in a lean product development cycle. 

#### Objective 

I want to work for a Product Agency, an agency that’s contracted out to build products for their clients. These agencies work on the entire product development cycle, from UX research to possibly marketing. As a do-it-all, I’m really attracted to working and learning in this environment. 

#### Strategy

My strategy follows this rough process: 

*   **Network.** Which product agencies can I be easily connected with? These are the agencies I’ll have the best chance at engaging
*   **Research.** What are the brands of these companies? By knowing their inner motivation and purpose, I can learn what they look for in prospective hires. 
*   **Brand.** How can I tailor my own brand to what they’re looking for? 
*   **Design.** Design up my website/portfolio/resume/etc. 
*   **Build.** Build out my website/portfolio/resume/etc. 
*   **Contact.** Use my network to get in touch with product agencies. Our industry is very karma based, everyone will be willing to help out if you ask. Just remember to pay it forward!

#### Network 

My friend [Robyn Larsen](http://robynlarsen.ca/) said she’d help connect me with companies she knows in Toronto. I was planning on asking multiple people, but her response listed enough companies for research’s sake. They were: 

*   [TWG](https://twg.io/)
*   [Rangle.io](https://rangle.io/)
*   [Symbility Intersect](https://www.symbilitysolutions.com/symbility-intersect/)
*   [Metalab](https://metalab.co/)

When I get to the connect step, I’ll ask more friends to connect me with companies they know. But for now, let’s look up these companies! 

#### Research

The front page of all four sites are focused on converting potential clients. There isn’t a lot of information on their company culture, which is what I need to break down their brand filter. 

> A brand filter is used for marketing to help a organize and strategize a brand. It covers the brand’s motivation, purpose, values, persona and behaviour (in that order), each using the previous to determine the next. Building marketing campaigns this way help build/maintain the brand’s brand. 

TWG’s brand is all about how software experiences can change the world. Rangle is about curiosity and passion
