Today I walked around Toronto, the same streets I walked around three and a half years ago.

Memories flooded back like watching ghosts. “Here’s the bank I deposited my first Developer earnings in”, “Here’s where I had my first beer”, “Here’s where I bought the earmuffs I’m wearing right now!”

But I saw the people too. From the professionals that walk with their heels and nice coats to the students and other people that wander the city, everyone here has a purpose and they dress for it. It looks so good.

The vibe left a major impression on me three and a half years ago. I completely changed my wardrobe after that summer, and a year later I was wearing slacks and a collar nearly every day. I had a look thanks to Toronto. I cared about my image thanks to Toronto.

Today I find myself in a similar situation. I don’t have a look, I don’t know what I’m dressing for everyday.

I want to change that, and I think I will now.

Thanks Toronto, you again are the city that keeps building me up.
