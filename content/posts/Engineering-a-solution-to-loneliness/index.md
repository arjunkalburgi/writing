I’m not sure the title is totally accurate…

What I mean is that I’m an engineering student that can fix my own depressive lulls.

Last semester I went through a depressive lull. I call it a lull because it wasn’t exactly depression, the word is already over-diluted, but I was definitely down, off, miserable, lost — for like a month.

It didn’t help that my solution to my mood issue couldn’t be made in effect until this year, five months later. I was not in a good mental state.

But then I went to Iceland for 3 weeks, and spent the following 4 months in my mom’s home (emphasis on _mom’s_, ❤).

We’re now only two weeks into the school year, and already I can tell my solution is working.

I’ve completely diversified the amount of people and projects I spend time with. I spent quality time with people in person, and roll with my busy schedule as I make it more busy.

I’m sooooo proud of myself. But I’m not content, I guess that’s growth mindset for ya.
