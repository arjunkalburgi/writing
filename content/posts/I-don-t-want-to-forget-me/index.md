“_Youth can not know how age thinks and feels, but old men are guilty if they forget what it is to be young_” — Dumbledore, Order of the Phoenix.

I recently re-read all the Harry Potter books and when I read that quote in the midst of following Harry’s difficult journey, it really spoke to me.

> I thought, how would you avoid this? How are you supposed to remember what it is to be young as you age?

I’m young now, I don’t want to forget what I’m like when I’m old.

I kept thinking about this into January, and when the new 10 years challenge took Instagram by storm it became even more important to me.

I would be lying if I told you I remembered any of these moments, much less how I thought or how I behaved.

Clearly photos aren’t enough to satisfy that main question. But videos could be.

So I’m going to start vlogging again, just for myself. And not necessarily about something interesting, I just want to tell my future self about my current self and how life is going. How I feel and how I think.

Maybe if interesting things are happening in my life I’ll edit it together and post it. But right now it’s more important to just film. I don’t want to forget me.
