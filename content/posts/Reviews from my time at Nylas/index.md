It's a product manager's job to be in the middle of everything and everyone. That's the only way to be in the center of the flow of information and to have context on everything needed to drive your project forward.

This makes a really interesting problem for me specifically. How do I show my work?

As a developer, I would always write blog posts and do side projects in order to show what I'm capable of. Unfortunately, as a PM, this most important skill cannot be shown.

One of my PM mentors told me that all PMs need is their resume, but I find them lacking. 

Instead, I had this idea to compile a list of reviews and thoughts from my colleagues on what it's like to work with me. Naturally it's biased towards the good stuff, but I think it's pretty remarkable what some people had to say.


When I think of Nylas I think of you! You truly represent the company and are always so present. They were too lucky to have you.
Recruiter I worked with on my muse profile 

    You are amazing, you light up a room, and you work your ass off.
