I‚Äôve been looking into SVG animations for my project, [Slackify](https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/redesigning-slackify-an-easy-custom-emoji-solution-for-slack-41c81b76e2be). I found that SVG offers a great [animate property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate) and so I decided I‚Äôd animate a brand new logo for Slackify.

I planned out my animation and in Figma I created several SVG‚Äôs. `animate` only works if all the paths in your SVG have the same number of points.

I ended up creating:

Not special but fun to try out. I also made this [codepen of the svg](https://codepen.io/askalburgi/pen/vQOJLE).

Don‚Äôt click it, it doesn‚Äôt work. Turns out `animate`'s browser support isn‚Äôt that great.

I decided to try it in the React-Native Slackify app anyway. I found a nice little package to embed my SVG as an Image in the app, [react-native-remote-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-remote-svg), after trying a lot of other options that didn‚Äôt work at all.

But unfortunately the animated SVG did not load in the app.

I also tried to load the SVG in a React-Native `WebView`, thinking maybe the WebView‚Äôs browser support would be different, but unfortunately that didn‚Äôt work either.

So I‚Äôve got:

ü§∑üèæ‚Äç Oh well.

If you know how I could have done this _properly_ in React-Native, **please let me know!** I really want to learn.
