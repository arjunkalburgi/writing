> I’ve always been fascinated with sketch notes and bullet journalling. Recently I started trying my hand.

Just like with learning Vue, my process to start sketch noting was to learn via video first.

I started with this YouTube playlist about sketch notes. They go over ideas of how you can create imagery for different phrases/concepts.

Honestly I think there is probably better content out there to learn this, but Mike Rhode is the author of the Sketchnote Handbook so I watched his videos first. I started getting the concepts and applying them to my notes!

Some are more art than others, while some have been more notes than art.

I want to continue learning more note/art techniques to keep my sketch-noting going! If you have any resources or advice, [Tweet at me](http://twitter.com/askalburgi)!
