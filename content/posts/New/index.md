Today my friends [Wayland](https://www.instagram.com/big_bang_wayland/) and [Harkit](https://www.instagram.com/harkit18/) joined me for a photoshoot

Afterwards we went to [Strategy Lab](https://www.instagram.com/stratlab/) and spoke with [Jeph Maystruck](https://www.instagram.com/jephmaystruck/) about media and doing and building companies.

I’ve been thinking about some of the things he said since I spoke at Big Idea Camp a few weeks ago. One of the reasons is, my old triangle logo wasn’t cutting it. It didn’t represent me, or what I was doing.

So it’s in with that newnew.

My strongest traits, the ones those closest to me will understand are my dedication towards growth, action, engagement and altruism.

Trees are great, they grow bigger, they engage with the elements, they act on the challenges they face — growing regardless of what’s in their way, and they show so much compassion for the living things around them.

These are the things I strive for, the values I make every decision with. But I’m no tree, I’m still starting. So imma leaf.

In that photoshoot, I’m just trying to have fun. This leaf let’s me do that. We’re going to start seeing a lot more content out of me from here on.
