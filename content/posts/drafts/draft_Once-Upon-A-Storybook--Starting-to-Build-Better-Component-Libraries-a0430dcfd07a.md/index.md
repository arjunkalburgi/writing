> Iâ€™ve learned about Design Systems recently and for my new app I wanted to start exploring them by using StorybookJs.Â 

Ever been a designer and a developer and wanted to stop making components twice, once in your design tool, then again in code? This is what motivated me to try StorybookJs, although I wonâ€™t really be using it to solve that problem, yet.Â 

Instead, StorybookJs also helps me organize my components, test them later on, and, best of all, develop them in an abstracted way.Â 

I began by reading [Storybook Driven Development](https://medium.com/nulogy/storybook-driven-development-a3c517276c07) by [Ned Schwartz,](https://medium.com/u/2e96c7be4493) it starts off with a much better explaination of why we should use Storybook Driven Development (SDD) than Iâ€™ve given here. I highly recommend reading it.Â 

After reading that I went to [storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org/) to set up StorybookJs for my Angular project. All was good until I did the first step. Turns out Storybook for Angular is having issues right now and I wasted a couple hours trying to fix it.Â 

> Days later I came back to finish adding StorybookJs to my project by updating my project to Ionic v4 and AngularÂ 7.Â 

Now with Storybook, this gif (from the tutorial linked above) shows how Iâ€™m going to start building and styling components.Â

All thanks goes to [Varun Vachhar](https://medium.com/u/1aeed18fd27d) for showing me Storybook and encouraging me always ðŸ˜ƒ
