Last weekend I was struck with motivation to update my website copy. I had been thinking about it for well over a year but haven‚Äôt been quite sure on what or how I needed to go about it. 

For nearly two years the website copy struck a dreamer tone, gushing about creating magic and a cheesy line about making users smile. The site also strongly featured my fascination with being a unicorn (developer-designer hybrid) which now, a few years later, means nothing more to me than some skills I have. 

Clearly this website didn‚Äôt reflect me anymore. And when I wrote a peppy introduction for a new Slack team I joined, I somehow knew that my site needed more of that tone - more me. 


## The writing process

So I went about writing this new copy using the same storytelling process my cousin taught me in this vlog I made. 
```
1. Start at the end goal
2. Decide on the emotional journey
3. Fill the plot points 
4. Smooth it over
```

I followed this process to a tee, all in a [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/arjunkalburgi/status/1365904663137116160):
```
Arjun @arjunkalburgi: 

My website copy needs a refresh.
This is my potentially super long thread of me doing this.

First I started with the end goal: 
```
I want the audience to take away that I'm a 
contagious energy, with a wide skill set that 
finds joy from exploring.
```

Then I decided on the emotional journey I wanted the readers to take: 
```
1. Start upbeat and bold, so the audience is like wow this guy. 
2. But then get thoughtful and a little deep (not too deep) 
3. Coast on that balance for a bit 
4. Then tightly wrap it up with some joy
```
Then the plot points to go with the emotional journey 
```
1. Bold introduction 
2. Core drive 
3. Things I've done 
4. Continuing exploring
```
And finally writing it. I went through 3 drafts, all on Twitter, until I got to something I was happy with. 
```
The Mission: Connect ü§ôüèæ Make üî® Smile üòÅ 

I'm a doer. What can I say, I got that extrovert energy. 

I think being a people-person fuels my curiosity. I mean, 
how crazy would it be to build something at scale, that just 
works for so many unique personalities?

For that dream, I've been a developer, a designer, organized 
project specs, mapped out business models and talked to 
experts in all kinds of different fields. 

Human beings are so complicated, peace out I gotta go learn more!
```

## Summary

I was so amazed by how nicely the process worked and even more surprised with how nicely it was to iterate on Twitter (although I wish the character count was larger! haha). 

I have more faith than ever in this process now and will be using it much more often!
