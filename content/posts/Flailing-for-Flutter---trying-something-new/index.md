> Looking to create a new app and I wanted to experiment with Flutter. My two concerns of [themeing](https://medium.com/@mx_tino/flutter-themes-9cebc0fecd1d) and [charts](https://medium.com/flutter-io/beautiful-animated-charts-for-flutter-164940780b8c) were alieviated by two blog posts, but letâ€™s try itÂ out!

### Installing Flutter

The dreaded step is always installing an SDK just for experimentingâ€¦ but here we go.

Installation Link: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

I needed to fix some installation issues which Flutter helped me out with. For a front-end developer, this was really helpful.

Unfortunately it also took forever, thanks to XCode.

After forever, weâ€™re now ready to go! (Iâ€™m choosing to work in VS Code)

### Andriod Emulator and iOS Simulator

Before I could get to coding I had to set up the Android and iOS devices on my machine. Fortunately I had ones set up for previous projects, I just needed to launch them like so:

```bash
$ flutter emulators  
$ flutter emulators --launch Pixel\_2\_XL\_API\_28  
$ flutter emulators --launch iOS Simulator  
$ flutter run -d all
```

This runs the starter app on both!

### Starter App

Now to start messing around! Iâ€™m using [this tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) provided from the Flutter team as a start.

With the tutorial, I created a list (useful) and started learning about Flutterâ€™s state (not really though).

I continued on to [part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/#0), which had me add interactive icons to list items to save them, navigate to a page to view saved list items, and begin theming the app.

### Theming

Theming is one of the big reasons I wanted to try Flutter and itâ€™s got a theming framework I wanted to try.

Times andÂ Blue

First try at theming was promising, even just with changing the font and the primary colour. I feel like itâ€™s generally stuck to the typical Material Design layout with the AppBar shadow and the darker background colour. Fortunately, I was quickly able to fix those, but Iâ€™m not certain I can make Flutter bend to **all** my UI wishes, would need more exploration.

### Graphs

Equally important as theming is the ability to have good graphs. For this Iâ€™m looking at [charts\_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/charts_flutter) recommended by the quick tutorial [blog post here](https://medium.com/flutter-io/beautiful-animated-charts-for-flutter-164940780b8c).

The tutorial is to get a bar chart up but I need a line chart with specific properties, which proved to be much more difficult thanks to some of the code from the bar chart tutorial messing me up. I had to redo the bar chart demo a couple of times and add in [this Line Chart demo](https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/time_series_charts/simple) carefully.

I donâ€™t care for my chart being interactive, so I dropped that extra fluff from the tutorial. What I need is to make the graph moveable and zoomable along the yaxis, which I donâ€™t think _flutter\_charts_ will be able to do.

But I tried anyway, starting with a bunch of different tutorials from [here](https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/gallery.html). I actually ran into a lot of errors while trying to set all these up and while some of them were clearly due to my unfamiliarity with Flutter, some of them were very: ðŸ¤¨. Thatâ€™s a drawback.

I ended up finding the [Numeric Initial Viewport Axes Example](https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/axes/numeric_initial_viewport) which did the scrolling y-axis for me and just needed to combine it with the [Selection Callback Interactions Example](https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/example/behaviors/selection_callback_example.html) (which features a TimeSeriesChart, which I need). This actually proved to be quite difficult.

In the end I wasnâ€™t able to get it to work seemingly due to a [bug that hasnâ€™t been fixed](https://github.com/google/charts/issues/134). This is how it wouldâ€™ve worked though, by setting up a viewport and allowing PanAndZoomBehavior.:

```javascript
new charts.TimeSeriesChart(  
  widget.seriesList,  
  animate: widget.animate,  
  domainAxis: new charts.DateTimeAxisSpec(  
     viewport: new charts.DateTimeExtents(  
          start: new DateTime(2017, 10, 3),   
          end: new DateTime(2017, 10, 10))),  
  behaviors: \[new charts.PanAndZoomBehavior()\],  
  selectionModels: \[new charts.SelectionModelConfig(  
     type: charts.SelectionModelType.info,  
     changedListener: \_onSelectionChanged,  
  )\],  
)
```

Turns out Flutter isnâ€™t capable of the graphing I needÂ :(

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Flutter seems like a pretty cool way to make apps but unfortunately itâ€™s chart library isnâ€™t functional and customizable enough.

Looks like Iâ€™m sticking to Ionic Angular with plot.lyÂ :)
