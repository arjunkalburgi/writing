> In this trimester, I’m preparing to go to 5 hackathons. Including organizing [one](http://hackedbeta.compeclub.com), that’s 6 hackathons I’m involved with in a 4 month period. Why?!

Back when I first started my degree, I told myself the two most important things for me to do are to learn as much as I can and to build technology that enabled people.

Last year I went through a boring and unfulfilling year at school. Classes were lecture style, where I would fall asleep, and I barely built anything that I was truly passionate about.

I can’t live like that.

I refuse to live like that.

This year, I’m spending time and money on myself. Hackathons are for **my** development and for **my** wellbeing. I’m having the greatest time of my life.
