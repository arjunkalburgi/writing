Sitting at my desk. My laptop in front of me.

A friend just messaged me. I have a lot of tabs open. I’m also working on my assignment.

I hear the music on in my room, I see my clothes, I feel the heater.

The door is closed but I know my roommates are cooking in the kitchen, watching the basketball game too.

There’s a dog barking outside.

Sitting at my desk. My laptop in front of me.

I’m working on my assignment.

(The second one is focus. It’s beauty.)
