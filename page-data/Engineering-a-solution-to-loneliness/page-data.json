I call it a lull because it wasn’t exactly depression, the word is already over-diluted, but I was definitely down, off, miserable, lost — for like a month.</p>\n<p>It didn’t help that my solution to my mood issue couldn’t be made in effect until this year, five months later. I was not in a good mental state.</p>\n<p>But then I went to Iceland for 3 weeks, and spent the following 4 months in my mom’s home (emphasis on <em>mom’s</em>, ❤).</p>\n<p>We’re now only two weeks into the school year, and already I can tell my solution is working.</p>\n<p>I’ve completely diversified the amount of people and projects I spend time with. I spent quality time with people in person, and roll with my busy schedule as I make it more busy.</p>\n<p>I’m sooooo proud of myself. But I’m not content, I guess that’s growth mindset for ya.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RdfHmg9CrUkkUfreOj0wuw.png\" alt=\"Reflecting on life in the glow of the sun.
