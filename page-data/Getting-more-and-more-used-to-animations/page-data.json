But recently that’s changing, mostly because I don’t want to deal with this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8fs1I6BtirDdLZiwoza_xw.png\" alt=\"An excerpt from a 63 page JS file, size 12 font\">\nAn excerpt from a 63 page JS file, size 12 font</p>\n<p>Websites I’m finding have a lot of JavaScript, too much for my low patience to go through. So, I’ve been making the animations on my own.</p>\n<p>It all started with some falling leaves:</p>\n<p>Learning that super simple TweenMax tweens and a lot of playing around. Slowly I started understanding how the tween settings worked.</p>\n<p>Next came when I was working on my newest project, my Online Library. I wanted to copy the side menu slide-out I found online. Instead of dealing with that site’s minified and messy JS, just making my own.</p>\n<p>I found this great gallery animation from <a href=\"http://www.andrgavr.com/en/\">www.andrgavr.com</a> and after trying to hack it together with the menu slide out animation, my head went “I can just make that”.</p>\n<p>And I did.</p>\n<p>This one still needs some fine tuning, but I’m loving my newfound animation confidence.</p>\n<p>Next I’m going to try recreating this gif in After Effects and using Lottie to get it into my Online Library project</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OXD9RfgmQzgVODT3_xj08A.gif\"></p>\n<p>Post to come about my Online Library soon, just got to get these animations done :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hw6Xjc3RJxvdLnrbYrERPg.jpeg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting more and more used to animations 🚀","date":"January 20, 2019","description":"I’m finding myself say “I can just make that myself” more and more often when I’m taking inspiration and hacking websites together."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/getting-more-and-more-used-to-animations/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/creating-a-custom-loading-spinner-for-android/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a Custom Loading Spinner for Android 🤖"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-don-t-want-to-forget-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I don’t want to forget me"}}}}}
