The conversation continued to moving on from your stressors and self-help. I realized this post contains more meaning than I originally assigned to it.</p>\n<p>The post is about how I only stress out over the things that will happen in the future. I spend my energy worrying about how things will work out as opposed to how things already happened. That’s a really good thing.</p>\n<p>Obviously, it would be better to stress out only about the things we can control (which is a subset of the things that will happen in the future). But it’s a step :) I just wanted to share this little proud moment of realization.</p>\n<p>Also, more pictures:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mx19kFTWUbwV8KBpMW4eEw.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lVJ5o6GwyjGTDNcNeANnJA.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3_pVQ9n_GCOr21L_hhVuJQ.png\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Confidence and anxiety, past and future","date":"December 14, 2017","description":"I posted to Instagram a while back,"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Confidence-and-anxiety--past-and-future/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Self-mental-health-care/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Self mental health care"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/6he-6ty-that-ma6e-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"6he 6ty that ma6e me"}}}}}
