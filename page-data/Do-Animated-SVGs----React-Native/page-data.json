I found that SVG offers a great <code>[animate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate)</code> <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate\">property</a> and so I decided I‚Äôd animate a brand new logo for Slackify.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AtJwk7_cpzGFJI6nZkMsjg.png\"></p>\n<p>I planned out my animation and in Figma I created several SVG‚Äôs. <code>animate</code> only works if all the paths in your SVG have the same number of points.</p>\n<p>I ended up creating:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MvBfM58ir8Y4S17gJyBzzw.gif\"></p>\n<p>Not special but fun to try out.

Turns out <code>animate</code>'s browser support isn‚Äôt that great.</p>\n<p>I decided to try it in the React-Native Slackify app anyway. I found a nice little package to embed my SVG as an Image in the app, <code>[react-native-remote-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-remote-svg)</code>, after trying a lot of other options that didn‚Äôt work at all.</p>\n<p>But unfortunately the animated SVG did not load in the app.</p>\n<p>I also tried to load the SVG in a React-Native <code>WebView</code>, thinking maybe the WebView‚Äôs browser support would be different, but unfortunately that didn‚Äôt work either.</p>\n<p>So I‚Äôve got:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bfzlPng2aLxqJDms2hS8zQ.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>ü§∑üèæ‚Äç Oh well.</p>\n<p>If you know how I could have done this <em>properly</em> in React-Native, <strong>please let me know!</strong> I really want to learn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OoTeOBZ4tF09RWuXkXNihA.jpeg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Do Animated SVGs üíî React-Native?","date":"November 06, 2018","description":"I‚Äôve been looking into SVG animations for my project, Slackify.
