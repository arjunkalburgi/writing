It’s awesome.</p>\n<p>I used to say “I’m not creative, I can’t do that”.</p>\n<p>The message of the pictures is to respond to this, saying that you can in fact do that and be creative.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that the word creative is misused when people say “I’m not creative”. What they mean is, “I’m not artsy”.</p>\n<p>There are so many ways to be creative and we’re all creative in so many ways. Any type of organizing or critical thinking is in fact creativity. It took me a long time to learn this and I think I’m still understanding it.</p>\n<p>I kept the word <em>creative</em> in the captions of the pictures because I wanted to make one point not two. Too confusing otherwise</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OoTeOBZ4tF09RWuXkXNihA.jpeg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thinking about being creative","date":"September 28, 2018","description":"I used to say “I’m not creative, I can’t do that”."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018-09-28_Thinking-about-being-creative-a3bee574163.md/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-09-22_Potentially-Potent-Product-Design---Got-Expertise-OnBoarding-Project-6c3903a1ddff.md/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Potentially Potent Product Design — Got Expertise OnBoarding Project"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-10-10_Redesigning-Slackify--an-easy-custom-emoji-solution-for-Slack-41c81b76e2be.md/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Redesigning Slackify, an easy custom emoji solution for Slack"}}}}}
