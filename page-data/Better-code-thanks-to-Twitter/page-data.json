The coding culture on the Internet is great.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been really annoyed with the <em>leaves animation</em> on my portfolio.</p>\n<p>Though unnoticeable in use on my website, I hated how the leaves would bounce back and forth between two points but I didn’t really know how I could fix it (I’m new to animations).</p>\n<p>I’ve been following <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/1aeed18fd27d\">Varun Vachhar</a> on Twitter for some time and see his animation work all the time. Now that I moved my job search to Toronto, I decided to go out of my comfort zone and reach out to him about helping me on my animation. His response was more than I could’ve asked for!</p>\n<p>Click the Tweet to see the thread!</p>\n<p>He ended up making a CodePen that forked mine, showing me that GSAP can re-run the animation after completion:</p>\n<p>I made some tweaks to it and ended up with the following, which is now applied to my website! It’s a much more natural movement for the leaves! Thanks Varun!</p>\n<p>In that same thread, Varun also talked about using <a href=\"https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise\">p5 to animate noise</a>, something I’ve never even heard of. I asked him to meet for coffee so I could learn more and he told me all kinds of background information about animation frameworks that I never knew! I think it’ll really help me learn animations moving forward because up till now it’s really been throwing darts in the dark.</p>\n<p>So I guess what I learned is that the process of randomly tweeting at people for code mentorship is pretty awesome! I’m definitely going to do it more.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Better code thanks to Twitter","date":"April 21, 2019","description":"Recently I sent a tweet to a stranger that I follow on Twitter asking for his help.
