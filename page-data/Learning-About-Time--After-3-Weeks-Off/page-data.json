Because now I have a job where I work until I burn out — I’m learning how to not do that.</p>\n<p>This recent trip started in New York with a half-week with my cousins, where we walked all day and everywhere.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*o_GXcdRRPC2oFaRa\"></p>\n<p>Then continued for a week with some more family, where we were such a big group we could only manage to visit one or two tourist attractions per day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*s17pide54h3pTX80\"></p>\n<p>The trip continued further to LA, where even more family met up to take a week-long cruise down Mexico’s Pasific coast.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rJKeiFk6y25dKPhq\"></p>\n<p>And because it was cheaper to fly out of LA a few days after the cruise docked, I stayed with my uncle in LA for 2 days.</p>\n<p>So effectively I had a vacation (2 days in LA) for the vacation (cruise) for the vacation (touring NY). I was so fresh and high spirited upon coming back from this trip. I was excited about coming in to work this week, until I sat down to actually work…</p>\n<p>Groggy, lethargic, and unfocused. I spent the week diving into my backlog looking for work that I would be able to concentrate on and I’m actually still finding it so difficult to work.</p>\n<p>But I’m taking it easy, working myself back into my routine, because I’m learning that time is fickle, and things take time. 😃</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ebk-yRePl4dmId30.jpg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learning About Time, After 3 Weeks Off","date":"August 05, 2019","description":"When I graduated University, my cousin told me that my next challenge would be learning routine, and with it, to respect time.
