Here I did the same thing but with the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/\">GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP, GreenSock)</a>.</p>\n<p>Although I could have done the animation entirely in CSS, the purpose of this experiment was to see how I could animate using the multiple SVGâ€™s I had created previously.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AtJwk7_cpzGFJI6nZkMsjg.png\"></p>\n<p>This is the same screenshot of my Figma design asset from before. There are 4 paths here that I want to animate to each other with an easing between them.</p>\n<p>With SVGâ€™s <code>animate</code> the preferred effect was not achieved, though mostly the basic motion was.</p>\n<p>At first I had a lot of trouble trying to adapt my SVGâ€™s because GSAP isnâ€™t perfectly meant to be used to manipulate the <code>d</code> path of SVG elements. However, I eventually figured out how to do it after a bunch of Google searches.</p>\n<p>tl.to(dotA,<br>\n0.8, {<br>\nattr: {<br>\nd: \"M59.0596 ... 959Z\"<br>\n},<br>\nease: Power1.easeInOut,<br>\n})</p>\n<p>The trick just happened to be to wrap the <code>d</code> modification in the <code>attr</code> block. This successfully applied the <code>dotA</code> path element in the SVG with the new <code>d</code> path.</p>\n<p>I went on to apply this same animation to the other 4 path elements.</p>\n<p>The final result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GOG3jx9dVNpwbrq4TjvZAA.gif\"></p>\n<p>I have a theory as to why there is that strange sharpness of the dots during the animation, but thatâ€™s for another blog!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cuvajqmhcC8_croNpCLZFg.png\"></p>\n<p>Thank you!
