The <strong>product</strong> has an associate <a href=\"https://shoutboxextension.herokuapp.com/\">website</a> is a redesign of an even older project. The design is taken from <a href=\"http://html5up.net\">html5up.net</a> and should thus have decent design.</p>\n<h3>Walkthrough</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6CT8bb4QpH3k8GrmDX7BSQ.png\"></p>\n<p>The ShoutBox website begins with a beautiful banner with nice colours and animation. The text copy reminds users what they are getting into. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*7S71KjBYabKKCmmfiNXsPQ.png\"></p>\n<p>The next section explains what is needed from the user. Content here is acceptable, but the text is small in comparison to how large the whitespace is, the action button draws no attention and the image doesn’t convey any meaning. </p>\n<p>Looking closer at the image, it actually does convey clarity to the user, but it is too chaotic and the message is unclear. If the background was blurred out and sunken slightly from the browser window, it might be better. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Jyyw43Z8wm6lLS-ADylPHQ.png\"></p>\n<p>These next sections are unimportant, but the design doesn’t do anything to convey that. Same issues with the pictures and the small text, but not with the buttons/links. Since these links are not an important action, this design is okay here. </p>\n<p>The addition of the header to remind users where they are is nice. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*FsIaH0oQPIpF-YexdiWVAA.png\"></p>\n<p>Something tells me there’s a smarter way to ask for donations. Starting a sentence with “If you would…” seems too passive. The donate button itself is also very passive. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*DkZ32-3n_qeHhYqL82s9Ww.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*giMBZBy7NDmLnWMEexS2yg.png\"></p>\n<p>Ending off with contact info and credits is nice, but signifies the weirdest part of the website — that the site is a combination of a main action and additional information in the style of a homepage. If I re-did the ShoutBox website, I would make it a proper homescreen, with a link to the Chrome extension and a more pronounced donate button.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ShoutBox","date":"Invalid date","description":"Introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/drafts/draft_ShoutBox-f33db2b88382.md/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/drafts/draft_Once-Upon-A-Storybook--Starting-to-Build-Better-Component-Libraries-a0430dcfd07a.md/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Once Upon A Storybook: Starting to Build Better Component Libraries"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-new-blog--a-new-me---a-renewed-focus-on-creating-value-with-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A new blog, a new me — A renewed focus on creating value with design"}}}}}
