How are you supposed to remember what it is to be young as you age?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m young now, I don’t want to forget what I’m like when I’m old.</p>\n<p>I kept thinking about this into January, and when the new 10 years challenge took Instagram by storm it became even more important to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*U9vtIaWqtGWZIp36\" alt=\"Photos of me in 2008 and 2009\">\nPhotos of me in 2008 and 2009</p>\n<p>I would be lying if I told you I remembered any of these moments, much less how I thought or how I behaved.</p>\n<p>Clearly photos aren’t enough to satisfy that main question.

And not necessarily about something interesting, I just want to tell my future self about my current self and how life is going. How I feel and how I think.</p>\n<p>Maybe if interesting things are happening in my life I’ll edit it together and post it. But right now it’s more important to just film. I don’t want to forget me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hw6Xjc3RJxvdLnrbYrERPg.jpeg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I don’t want to forget me","date":"January 28, 2019","description":"“Youth can not know how age thinks and feels, but old men are guilty if they forget what it is to be young” — Dumbledore, Order of the…"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/I-don-t-want-to-forget-me/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Getting-more-and-more-used-to-animations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting more and more used to animations 🚀"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Personalizing-Images-at-the-CBC-Hackathon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Personalizing Images at the CBC Hackathon"}}}}}
