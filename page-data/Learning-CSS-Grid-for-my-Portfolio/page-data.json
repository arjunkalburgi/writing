As with <a href=\"https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/viewing-vue-with-theradlist-8851502ab709\">learning Vue.js</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/arty-notes-sketch-noting-my-thoughts-e29f142a9eb4\">learning sketch-noting</a>, I started with content.</p>\n<p>In this case it was this <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\">article</a> on CSS Tricks, it went over the basics of CSS Grid and how to use it.</p>\n<pre><code>.container {\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>.item {  grid-column-start: &#x3C;number>;  grid-column-end: &#x3C;number>;  grid-row-start: &#x3C;number>;  grid-row-end: &#x3C;number>; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this much alone I was able to begin using the Grid for what I needed. I didn’t need to go over <code>grid-template-areas</code>, grid gaps and item alignments. Although they would be really useful.</p>\n<p>Instead I needed this CodePen found in the article:</p>\n<p>I began working in my own CodePen and didn’t define my grid properly so I went to an example to see how they had done it.</p>\n<p>Once I figured it out I went on to finish recreating the layout. That became v1, which you can see here:</p>\n<p>Basic html and css</p>\n<p>Next I needed to animate the images like on my Portfolio. I copied over the Javascript and attached the necessary Javascript files (jQuery and <a href=\"https://tgomilar.github.io/paroller.js/\">Paroller</a>) to make the parallax effect.</p>\n<p>This became v2 which is here:</p>\n<p>Finally, I needed to make it responsive just like on my website. This is the real reason I wanted to update using CSS Grid. In the current version, I have additional HTML tags which I hide and show for mobile and desktop. I no longer wanted that extra HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p>I began with removing the <code>display: grid</code> from the container and then followed through adjusting all the other elements.</p>\n<p>And just like that. We have our completely old website with a brand new grid layout system. And by golly was that easy and pumpkin pie. The grid system is awesome for sure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/askalburgi/askalburgi.github.io/commit/00260e1192b41bc0e772f8c899e5ce8bae3d4ef2\">This is the commit</a> where I make the move to the Grid System. In the HTML, I’m able to reduce 40 lines of code and in the CSS, I’m able to reduce ~11 lines.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*ErpqfbqYAI0nxy1UXajRcQ.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*3g_xFvG3AO3u9fvzr7PGGQ.png\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*tT72BY7voH4t1u4L1uOIww.png\"></p>\n<p>Especially in the HTML, I was able to reduce a lot. Honestly it speaks more to the terrible HTML I had before than to how great the Grid System is, but either way, I was able to fix the issue that I had!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XnF2eYbJ32jpOj2pE6atHA.png\" alt=\"Image for the caption lol\">\nImage for the caption lol<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OoTeOBZ4tF09RWuXkXNihA.jpeg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learning CSS Grid for my Portfolio","date":"April 25, 2019","description":"Been seeing a lot about CSS Grid on Twitter, decided to fix some smelly HTML/CSS on my portfolio using it!"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Learning-CSS-Grid-for-my-Portfolio/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Poem-about-Home/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Poem about Home"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Flailing-for-Flutter---trying-something-new/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flailing for Flutter — trying something new"}}}}}
