HackED 2015 had some 60 students.</p>\n<p>This weekend there was some 170 students at the opening ceremonies, tripling the participants in 3 years. We featured workshops, HackED branded t-shirts and stickers, trivia prizes, and more. We have a dedicated team that continues to refine the structure of the event while also supporting more participants than ever.</p>\n<p>I remember every single event of how we came to this point. And to be honest, none of them are grand. I think thatâ€™s what growth really is, natural change over time. Itâ€™s only when you look back do you see it.</p>\n<p>And damn, I see it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Bjt2NwoxVm5Y1RzdXhfTvw.png\" alt=\"growthman\">\ngrowthman</p>\n<p>I canâ€™t wait to see where itâ€™ll grow next.
