Recently I started trying my hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just like with learning Vue, my process to start sketch noting was to learn via video first.</p>\n<p>I started with this YouTube playlist about sketch notes. They go over ideas of how you can create imagery for different phrases/concepts.</p>\n<p>Honestly I think there is probably better content out there to learn this, but Mike Rhode is the author of the Sketchnote Handbook so I watched his videos first. I started getting the concepts and applying them to my notes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5eiLBfngln98WE4C\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*P45jNEcpZ88jT_6D\"></p>\n<p>Some are more art than others, while some have been more notes than art.</p>\n<p>I want to continue learning more note/art techniques to keep my sketch-noting going!
